"""Wiring helper for the closed → exchange-flat invariant tick hook
(S-067 follow-up #3 Phase-2).

Phase-1 (PR #658) shipped the ``closed_flat_invariant`` module +
design memo + tests but no tick-loop wiring. This module is the
wiring — kept in its own file so the live-order-path edit to
``src/runtime/order_monitor.py`` is a single import + call site
(3 lines) rather than a full-file rewrite.

Usage from ``order_monitor.run_monitor_tick``, **after** the
orphan reconcilers and **before** ``return summaries``::

    from src.runtime._closed_flat_wiring import maybe_run_closed_flat_check
    maybe_run_closed_flat_check(db, summaries)

The helper:

* Reads ``CLOSED_FLAT_INVARIANT_ENABLED`` (default false). When
  unset/falsy, this is a no-op — Phase-2 ships in alert-only mode
  for a 7-day soak before the auto-flatten promotion PR.
* When enabled, builds an account resolver from
  ``order_monitor._load_account_cfgs_for_reconcile`` and calls
  ``closed_flat_invariant.check`` with it. Violations are logged to
  ``runtime_logs/invariant_violations.jsonl`` and Telegram'd via
  ``outcomes.report`` (the canonical alert path).
* Never raises — the existing orphan reconciler is the eventual
  safety net during the soak window.

See:
* ``docs/claude/closed-flat-invariant.md`` — design memo + rollout
  plan + trade-#1049 retrospective.
* ``docs/claude/closed-flat-invariant-phase2-wiring.md`` — the
  3-line ``order_monitor.py`` patch to apply (this PR).

    Parameters
    ----------
    db : Any
        Database wrapper (must support ``connect()``) or a
        ``sqlite3.Connection`` — same shape ``closed_flat_invariant.check``
        accepts.
    summaries : dict, optional
        If provided, the helper writes a
        ``__closed_flat_invariant__`` entry on violation
        (``{"violations": N, "phase": "alert_only"}``) so the caller's
        per-tick summary surfaces the count.

        would have been if ``summaries`` was ``None``). ``None`` when
        the env gate is off or no violations were found. Used by tests
        that pass ``summaries=None`` and inspect the return value.
