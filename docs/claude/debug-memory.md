# Debug memory

Use this file for recurring bugs so Claude does not rediscover them.

## Known patterns

- Use `PYTHONPATH=.` when running tests from repo root.
- Runtime validation tests may fail if function signatures drift from tests.
- Telegram-related tests need the `telegram` package or must be skipped/mocked.
- `.env` loading tests need `python-dotenv`.
- Never test live exchange behavior without explicit paper/live-mode instructions.

## Anti-patterns

- Running full backtests to verify a docs or config change.
- Hardcoding API keys in smoke scripts.
- Creating one-off notebooks without saving outputs to Drive/HF.
