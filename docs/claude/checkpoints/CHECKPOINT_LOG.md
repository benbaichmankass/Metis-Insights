## CP-2026-05-07-14-s047-T4-vwap-monitor-close-logic — S-047 T4: VWAP monitor close logic (TP/SL/VWAP-cross/time-decay)

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07 (continuation of `CP-2026-05-07-13`).
- **Sprint:** S-047 — bybit_2 Spot Margin enablement.
- **Active milestone:** M5 paused; S-047 active. **T4 shipped (work-PR #469 operator-merged 2026-05-07 ~16:24 UTC); T5 queued.**
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-13-s047-T3-spot-margin-routing-wiring` (PR #464 operator-merged 2026-05-07, unblocked T4).
- **Branches:** sprint-start ping-PR #468 on `claude/ping-S-047-T4-start` (self-merged at session start); work-PR #469 on `claude/vwap-monitor-close-logic-5AmRo` (Tier 3, DRAFT, operator-merged after explicit "merge" reply); merge-review ping-PR #470 on `claude/ping-S-047-T4` (self-merged after CI green); this close-checkpoint commit on `claude/cp-2026-05-07-s047-t4-close`.
- **Telegram sent:** ping-PR #468 (sprint-start) + ping-PR #470 (merge-review) self-merged after CI green; sprint-complete ping rides on this close-checkpoint commit.

### What this checkpoint completes

S-047 T4 D6: replace the v1 break-even-only stub in `src/units/strategies/vwap.py::monitor()` with four close paths plus the no-action path. The strategy unit produces verdicts; `src/runtime/order_monitor.py::_apply_update` translates them into reduce-only `close_open_position` calls against the linked trade row's `account_id` + `position_size` — the strategy never touches the exchange, preserving the "strategies are pure signal generators" architecture rule (CLAUDE.md § Architecture rules § 2).

Close priority (first match wins): **TP-cross** (`close ≥ tp` long / `≤` short — the TP was placed at the entry-time VWAP per `build_vwap_signal`, so this also covers "price returned to entry-VWAP"); **SL-cross** (`close ≤ sl` long / `≥` short); **VWAP-cross** (live VWAP recomputed each tick; once price crosses back through, the mean-reversion thesis has played out — skipped when `tp == vwap_live` so the more specific TP-cross reason wins); **time-decay** (open longer than `cfg["monitor_hold_window_minutes"]`, default `MONITOR_HOLD_WINDOW_MINUTES = 240` minutes — operator-tunable in `config/strategies.yaml`).

Spot-margin path inherits T3 D4 wiring (`isLeverage=1` + skipped pre-flight on `bybit_2`) so the new close paths flow through live order routing without further changes.

### Files changed (PR #469, operator-merged)

- `src/units/strategies/vwap.py` — new `monitor()` body + `MONITOR_HOLD_WINDOW_MINUTES` module constant + `_parse_created_at` defensive helper. The break-even-only delegation to `_base.monitor_breakeven_sl` is removed for vwap; turtle_soup still delegates to that helper unchanged.
- `config/strategies.yaml` — `vwap.monitor_hold_window_minutes: 240` added so the field is operator-discoverable. Module default applies until the runtime cfg threading is wired (separate sprint).
- `tests/units/strategies/test_vwap_monitor_close.py` (NEW) — 27 tests across 7 classes:
  - `TestTpCrossClose` (3 cases) — long ≥ tp, long == tp, short ≤ tp.
  - `TestSlCrossClose` (3 cases) — long at sl, long below sl, short above sl.
  - `TestVwapCrossClose` (3 cases) — long live-vwap-cross, short live-vwap-cross, long-still-below-vwap returns None.
  - `TestTimeDecayClose` (6 cases) — long past window, short past default 240-min window, fresh package within window, zero/negative window disables decay, TP-cross priority over time-decay, malformed `created_at` skipped silently.
  - `TestNoActionPath` (2 cases) — long + short within deviation band → None.
  - `TestMonitorDefensive` (8 cases) — empty df, None df, missing close column, missing pkg keys, unknown direction, zero-volume frame, cfg=None, garbage hold-window value.
  - `TestTurtleSoupUnaffected` (2 cases) — turtle_soup still uses break-even-after-1R; verdict is `{"sl": entry}`, not a close.
- `tests/test_s030_pr2_strategy_monitor_hook.py` — `TestVwapMonitor` class trimmed to the signature smoke test; the break-even-after-1R assertions removed (no longer the contract for vwap). Turtle_soup tests untouched.

### Compliance check (per § 4.4 — 5 bullets)

1. ✅ **No refuse-to-trade outside the dispatcher.** The four close paths act on already-open positions; they are not new pre-flight gates. The dispatcher's `live | dry_run` switch remains the only canonical execution gate per `docs/claude/workplan.md` § "Live / dry-run rule".
2. ✅ **No per-account refusal flag/branch.** No edits to `accounts.yaml`, `execute.py`, `coordinator.py`, or any per-account routing surface.
3. ✅ **No operator-run notebook / capture step.** The hold-window default is a module constant; the operator can edit `config/strategies.yaml` directly any time.
4. ✅ **Live-mode invariant passes.** `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean. No edits to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/notify.py`, `src/runtime/risk_counters.py`, `src/runtime/signal_writer.py`, `src/runtime/validation.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, or `src/units/accounts/*`.
5. ✅ **CI green.** `ruff check .` clean; `secret_scan.py` clean; `repo_inventory.py` clean; 27 new tests pass; 19 S-030 PR2 contract tests pass; pre-existing baseline failures in `test_vwap_strategy.py` (live-safety-gate cases) are unchanged vs. main HEAD `1c69eb6` — verified via `git stash` round-trip.

### Live-mode check

✅ no flip away from `live` anywhere in the diff. Files touched in the work-PR: `src/units/strategies/vwap.py`, `config/strategies.yaml`, `tests/test_s030_pr2_strategy_monitor_hook.py`, `tests/units/strategies/test_vwap_monitor_close.py` (NEW). Files touched in the ping-PRs: `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl` (one-line appends). Files touched in this close-checkpoint commit: `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md`, `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`, `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl`. None of these are live-routing paths.

### Hard guardrails (per S-047 plan § 7)

- ✅ `turtle_soup` strategy untouched — `TestTurtleSoupUnaffected` pins the v1 break-even-after-1R contract.
- ✅ `bybit_1` + `prop_velotrade_1` unaffected — no edits to routing.
- ✅ No edits to forbidden files (`src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/notify.py`, `src/runtime/risk_counters.py`, `src/runtime/signal_writer.py`, `src/runtime/validation.py`).

### Out-of-scope side-quest answered inline

Operator surfaced a live `170131 Insufficient balance` on `bybit_2` mid-session (Buy 0.002 BTCUSDT vs ~$177 USDT, with `isLeverage=1` already in the request). Diagnosis given inline: order is structurally correct now (T3 fixed `isLeverage=1` routing); the most likely root causes are (a) Bybit web-UI Spot Margin toggle still off on `bybit_2`, (b) account is on Classic Spot rather than UTA / Margin Trade tier, or (c) `availableBalance` is below `walletBalance` due to locked / borrowing reserves. Independent of T4 — no code change needed.

### Remaining (operator action)

- **None for T4.** Operator-merged PR #469 closes T4.
- **Bybit web-UI Spot Margin toggle on `bybit_2`** — independent of T4 ship; needed to actually unblock the live `isLeverage=1` flow (see side-quest above).

### Next session: S-047 T5

`feat(monitor): spot-margin borrow-position reconciler`. Read order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (router).
2. This entry (CP-14).
3. `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`.
4. `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` § 4.4 (5-bullet compliance check).
5. `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` D7 + T5 row + § 5b + § 7.
6. `src/runtime/order_monitor.py::_reconcile_open_trades` — current per-account snapshot loop; T5 teaches it to query the spot-margin borrow-position endpoint when `account.market_type == "spot-margin"`.
7. `src/units/accounts/clients.py::account_open_positions` — current per-account positions fetcher.

Tier 2 (live order routing / runtime orchestration). Draft PR + ping-PR + Merge/Hold buttons per § 4. T5 is gated on operator's "merge" reply on the work-PR.

## CP-2026-05-07-13-s047-T3-spot-margin-routing-wiring — S-047 T3: execute.py + coordinator spot-margin wiring (D4 + D5)

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07 (continuation of `CP-2026-05-07-12`).
- **Sprint:** S-047 — bybit_2 Spot Margin enablement.
- **Active milestone:** M5 paused; S-047 active. **T3 shipped (work-PR #464 operator-merged 2026-05-07); T4 queued.**
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-12-s047-T2-risk-spot-margin-sizing` (PR #459 operator-merged 2026-05-07 13:28 UTC, unblocked T3).
- **Branches:** work-PR #464 on `claude/S-047-T3-exec-coordinator-margin-wiring` (operator-merged after explicit "merge" reply); ping-PR #465 (self-merged before merge); ping-PR #466 (sprint-complete-T3, self-merged after work-PR merge).
- **Telegram sent:** #465 (merge-review) and #466 (T3-complete) fired via the standard ping-PR drain.

### Brief — back-fill (entry not authored at the time)

D4 (`execute.py`): pass `isLeverage=1` to every Bybit V5 spot `place_order` on `bybit_2` (Buy + Sell + close legs). Cash-spot accounts unchanged. The existing spot-sell pre-flight base-coin guard is **skipped** for spot-margin (the system can borrow the asset). retCodes 110007 (`MARGIN_TRADING_NOT_ENABLED`) and 110095 (insufficient borrow available) are logged through the existing `report_api_failure` path — no new gates.

D5 (`coordinator.multi_account_execute`): for spot-margin accounts the direction-aware balance fetch returns USDT collateral for **both** directions (matching the risk-manager's collateral semantics in T2 D3). Cash-spot accounts retain the existing per-direction balance behaviour. The `market_type` primitive is forwarded to `RiskManager.position_size()` so the T2 spot-margin kernel actually fires.

§ 4.4 5-bullet compliance: ✅ removes one refusal (spot-sell pre-flight for spot-margin), adds zero new gates; routing predicate not refusal flag; no operator notebook; live-mode clean; ruff/secret/dry-run/inventory clean; 25 new tests + 109 pre-existing related tests pass. Smoke harness `scripts/sprint047/spot_margin_smoke.py` runs against Bybit testnet (T6 territory). Tier 2/3 — DRAFT, never auto-merged, operator merge gated T4/T5/T6.

This CP-13 entry is back-filled here so the log invariant (every session writes a checkpoint before exiting) holds for the program record. The T3 session itself shipped the code + the two ping-PRs but did not author this log entry; the T4 session (this CP-14 author) is filing it on T3's behalf with the description above derived from PR #464's commit message + the merged ping payloads in `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl`.

## CP-2026-05-07-12-s047-T2-risk-spot-margin-sizing — S-047 T2: RiskManager spot-margin sizing kernel

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07 (continuation of `CP-2026-05-07-11`).
- **Sprint:** S-047 — bybit_2 Spot Margin enablement.
- **Active milestone:** M5 paused; S-047 active. **T2 shipped (work-PR draft awaiting operator merge); T3 queued.**
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-11-s047-T1-spot-margin-routing` (PR #456 operator-merged 2026-05-07 13:05 UTC, unblocked T2).
- **Branches:** work-PR #459 on `claude/S-047-T2-risk-spot-margin-sizing-MOY0f` (DRAFT, Tier 3 — never auto-merged); ping-PR #460 on `claude/ping-S-047-T2` (self-merged after CI green); this close-checkpoint commit on `claude/cp-2026-05-07-s047-t2-close`.
- **Telegram sent:** ping-PR #460 self-merged after CI green (per § 6 ping-PR pattern).

### What this checkpoint completes

S-047 T2 D3: upgrade `RiskManager.position_size()` so spot-margin accounts size from USDT collateral and apply three rules layered on the existing risk-pct kernel (max-borrow CAP, borrow-fee SCALE, liquidation-buffer REFUSAL). The routing label is consumed as a primitive `market_type: str = "spot"` keyword arg on the sizer; `RiskManager` does not inspect a `TradingAccount` — the unit boundary is preserved.

The sizer's zero-qty returns are the **existing** risk-manager refusal mechanism (same shape as `min_balance_usd` and the S-026 G3 daily-loss-budget rule). They are not new pre-flight gates. The dispatcher's `live | dry_run` switch remains the only canonical execution gate per `docs/claude/workplan.md` § "Live / dry-run rule".

### Files changed (PR #459, DRAFT)

- `src/units/accounts/risk.py` — `position_size()` gains a keyword-only `market_type: str = "spot"`. Spot-margin sizing math is isolated in a new private helper `_apply_spot_margin_rules` for readability and so future tuning has one place to live. Existing daily-loss-budget gate stays in the base kernel and runs **before** the spot-margin block, so daily-loss-budget refusal still wins on conflict.
- `tests/units/accounts/test_risk_spot_margin.py` (NEW) — 13 tests across 3 classes:
  - `TestSpotMarginSizing` (8 cases per S-047 § 6): long no-borrow, short with BTC borrow, liquidation-buffer violation, borrow-fee budget scaling, daily-loss-budget wins on conflict, min_qty floor respected, max_borrow_btc caps qty, balance < min_balance_usd → 0.
  - `TestNonSpotMarginRegression` (4 cases): default `market_type` unchanged, explicit `market_type="spot"` does not trigger spot-margin kernel (max_borrow_btc not consulted), S-026 G3 floor rounding invariant, smoke-test bypass on both paths.
  - `TestDefaultsStillMatchT1Contract` (1 case): defaults agree with T1's module constants.

### Compliance check (per § 4.4 — 5 bullets)

1. ✅ **No refuse-to-trade outside the dispatcher.** Diff adds zero new pre-flight gates. Two new zero-qty return paths (liquidation-buffer violation; daily-loss-budget exhausted) are the existing risk-manager refusal mechanism — same shape as `min_balance_usd` and the S-026 G3 daily-loss-budget rule already in `position_size()`.
2. ✅ **No per-account refusal flag/branch.** No new fields on `TradingAccount`, no new env var, no new schema entry in `accounts.yaml`. RiskManager does **not** inspect a `TradingAccount`; the routing label is passed in as a primitive `market_type` kwarg. Unit boundary preserved.
3. ✅ **No operator-run notebook / capture step.** The three risk-rule defaults T1 shipped (`max_borrow_btc=0.5`, `borrow_fee_apr_pct=10.0`, `liquidation_buffer_pct=30.0`) are the configuration surface; operator edits the constants directly or overrides per-account in the existing `risk:` block. No notebook is run, no value is captured from a live exchange query.
4. ✅ **Live-mode invariant passes.** `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean. No edits to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/execute.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, or any live-routing code path.
5. ✅ **CI green.** ruff clean on changed files; secret-scan clean; dry-run-in-diff clean; repo-inventory clean; 13 new tests pass; pre-existing baseline failures (`test_per_strategy_risk.py`, `test_s026_g{2,3}_*` Coordinator-stub tests, `test_runtime_risk_injection`) are unchanged vs. main HEAD `a74c49e` — verified via `git stash` round-trip.

### Live-mode check

✅ no flip away from `live` anywhere in the diff. Files touched in the work-PR: `src/units/accounts/risk.py`, `tests/units/accounts/test_risk_spot_margin.py` (NEW). Files touched in the ping-PR: `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl` (one-line append). Files touched in this close-checkpoint commit: `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md`, `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`. None of these are live-routing paths.

### Remaining (operator action)

- **Tier 3 merge decision on PR #459.** Work-PR is DRAFT, never auto-merged. Operator's explicit "merge" reply gates T3.
- **Bybit web UI Spot Margin toggle on `bybit_2`.** Margin-agnostic — happens on the operator's schedule, independent of T2/T3 shipping. Until the toggle is on, every `isLeverage=1` order returns retCode 110007 server-side and is logged via `report_api_failure`. T2 ships no `isLeverage=1` (that's T3).

### Next session: S-047 T3

`feat(exec): route spot-margin orders via isLeverage=1` + `feat(coordinator): direction-aware balance for spot-margin accounts` (D4 + D5 land together — one diff is incoherent without the other per S-047 plan T3). Read order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (router).
2. This entry (CP-12).
3. `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`.
4. `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` § 4.4 (5-bullet compliance check).
5. `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` D4 + D5 + T3 row + § 5b.
6. `src/units/accounts/execute.py` — current spot-sell pre-flight + `_bybit_category` routing.
7. `src/core/coordinator.py::multi_account_execute` — direction-aware balance fetch foundation (today-#441 / today-#446).

T3 is **gated on operator's "merge" reply on the work-PR #459** — do not start until then. Tier 2 (live order routing) — draft PR + ping-PR + Merge/Hold buttons per § 4.

## CP-2026-05-07-11-s047-T1-spot-margin-routing — S-047 T1: declare bybit_2 spot-margin in routing config

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07 (continuation of `CP-2026-05-07-10`).
- **Sprint:** S-047 — bybit_2 Spot Margin enablement.
- **Active milestone:** M5 paused; S-047 active. **T1 shipped (work-PR draft awaiting operator merge); T2 queued.**
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-10-s047-margin-agnostic`.
- **Branches:** work-PR #456 on `claude/accounts-yaml-spot-margin-uCbil` (DRAFT, Tier 3 — never auto-merged); ping-PR #457 on `claude/ping-S-047-T1` (self-merged after CI green); this close-checkpoint commit on `claude/cp-2026-05-07-s047-t1-close`.
- **Telegram sent:** ping-PR #457 self-merged after CI green (per § 6 ping-PR pattern).

### What this checkpoint completes

S-047 T1 D2: extend the existing `market_type` routing field to declare `bybit_2` as a Bybit V5 Spot Margin account, and land three spot-margin risk-rule defaults on `RiskManager` so T2's `position_size()` upgrade has the parameters it needs.

The routing label is **identity, not a gate**: non-spot-margin accounts follow a different code path; the dispatcher's `live | dry_run` switch remains the only canonical execution gate per `docs/claude/workplan.md` § "Live / dry-run rule".

### Files changed (PR #456, DRAFT)

- `config/accounts.yaml` — `bybit_2.market_type: spot` → `spot-margin`. Header documentation extended with the third routing value (`spot` / `linear` / `spot-margin`). `bybit_1` and `prop_velotrade_1` unchanged. **No new top-level `is_leverage` flag.**
- `src/units/accounts/risk.py` — three new module-level constants (`DEFAULT_MAX_BORROW_BTC=0.5`, `DEFAULT_BORROW_FEE_APR_PCT=10.0`, `DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_BUFFER_PCT=30.0`). `RiskManager.__init__` exposes them via the existing config-dict-with-fallback pattern — same surface as `min_balance_usd` / `risk_pct`. The defaults are values, not gates.
- `tests/test_s047_t1_spot_margin_routing.py` (NEW) — 21 tests across 4 classes:
  - production-`accounts.yaml` routing assertions (bybit_2 = spot-margin, bybit_1 unchanged, prop_velotrade_1 unchanged, no `is_leverage` flag anywhere)
  - loaded-account shape (market_type attribute, strategies unchanged, no auto-flip to dry_run)
  - RiskManager defaults (module constants + cfg overrides + the 30 % liquidation buffer per § 7)
  - end-to-end synthetic-YAML loader regression for the spot vs spot-margin distinction

### Compliance check (per § 4.4 — 5 bullets)

1. ✅ **No refuse-to-trade outside the dispatcher.** Diff adds zero new gates. The label routes; the params will be sized into qty in T2.
2. ✅ **No per-account refusal flag/branch.** No `is_leverage` boolean. No `if account.is_leverage: refuse` branch. No edits to `execute.py` or `coordinator.py`. Test enforces no `is_leverage` on the production YAML.
3. ✅ **No operator-run notebook / capture step.** The three risk parameters ship with hardcoded defaults in `risk.py`. Operator edits the constants or per-account `risk:` block — same pattern as `min_balance_usd`. No notebook is run, no value is captured from a live exchange query.
4. ✅ **Live-mode invariant passes.** `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean. No edits to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/execute.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, or any live-routing code path.
5. ✅ **CI green.** ruff `.` clean; secret-scan clean; dry-run-in-diff clean; repo-inventory clean; 21 new tests pass; zero new pytest collection errors vs. baseline (pre-existing pandas / PyO3 collection failures unaffected).

### Live-mode check

✅ no flip away from `live` anywhere in the diff. Files touched in the work-PR: `config/accounts.yaml`, `src/units/accounts/risk.py`, `tests/test_s047_t1_spot_margin_routing.py` (NEW). Files touched in the ping-PR: `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl` (one-line append). Files touched in this close-checkpoint commit: `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md`, `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`. None of these are live-routing paths.

### Remaining (operator action)

- **Tier 3 merge decision on PR #456.** Work-PR is DRAFT, never auto-merged. Operator's explicit "merge" reply gates T2.
- **Bybit web UI Spot Margin toggle on `bybit_2`.** Margin-agnostic — happens on the operator's schedule, independent of T1+ shipping. Until the toggle is on, every `isLeverage=1` order returns retCode 110007 server-side and is logged via `report_api_failure`. T1 ships no `isLeverage=1` (that's T3); T1 ships only the routing label and the risk-rule defaults.

### Next session: S-047 T2

`feat(risk): spot-margin sizing — collateral, liquidation, borrow fees`. Read order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (router).
2. This entry (CP-11).
3. `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`.
4. `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` § 4.4 (5-bullet compliance check).
5. `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` § 5b + T2 row.
6. `src/units/accounts/risk.py` — the three new attrs (`max_borrow_btc`, `borrow_fee_apr_pct`, `liquidation_buffer_pct`) are already on every `RiskManager` instance; T2 wires them into `position_size()` for spot-margin accounts only (gated by `account.market_type == "spot-margin"` upstream of the call site).

T2 is **gated on operator's "merge" reply on the work-PR #456** — do not start until then.

## CP-2026-05-07-10-s047-margin-agnostic — S-047 corrective: notebook deleted, system goes margin-agnostic

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07 (continuation of `CP-2026-05-07-09`).
- **Sprint:** S-047 — bybit_2 Spot Margin enablement.
- **Active milestone:** M5 paused; S-047 active. **T1 is the new starting checkpoint** — original T0 deleted.
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-09-s047-T0-complete` (superseded by this entry's corrective).
- **Branch:** `claude/S-047-margin-agnostic-correction` (PR #455 self-merged after CI green).

### What this entry corrects

`CP-2026-05-07-09` documented PR #452 (T0 notebook) and PR #453 (plan correction stripping `is_leverage` boolean + `if not margin_enabled: refuse` branch). Operator subsequently flagged that the corrected plan still contained a **workflow gate**: it asked the operator to run a notebook to verify margin enablement and capture the BTC max-borrow tier as input to T2's risk-manager rules. Even though the notebook had no runtime impact, conditioning T1+ on operator-extracted values is the same anti-pattern in spirit.

Operator's directive 2026-05-07 (verbatim):
> *"if it's not set on the account, then the order will get rejected, thats it - the system should agnostic to this and operate under the assumption that margin trading is enabled"*

### Files changed (PR #455)

- `notebooks/operator/enable_bybit_spot_margin.ipynb` — **DELETED**. The system no longer needs an operator-run notebook to verify exchange-side state.
- `docs/claude/colab-workflows.md` — row removed from "Existing operator notebooks" table.
- `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` — T0 row marked DELETED in checkpoint table; D1 deliverable marked DELETED; § 2 dependencies stripped of "operator action / parameter capture" language; § 5b extended with a fifth invariant (no operator-run notebooks for exchange-state capture); § 8 hand-off rewritten to reflect margin-agnostic operation.
- `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` § 4.4 — added a third bullet: "Does the diff put exchange-side state behind an operator-run notebook, manual capture step, or any 'operator extracts value, pastes into PR' workflow? **Workflow gates count.**" Captures both PR #450 (runtime gate) and PR #452 (workflow gate) as cautionary cases.
- `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` — "S-047 operator action remaining" block rewritten from operator-runs-notebook to "none required."
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` — this entry.

### S-047 operator action remaining: NONE

The operator clicks Enable Spot Margin in the Bybit web UI on `bybit_2` (Account → Margin Mode) on their own schedule. Whether they do so before, during, or after T1 ships is irrelevant to the sprint. Until the toggle is on, every `isLeverage=1` order returns retCode 110007 server-side and is logged via the existing `report_api_failure` path. After the toggle is on, orders flow through. There is no verification step, no notebook to run, no parameter to capture, no PR comment thread to update.

### Next session: S-047 T1

`feat(accounts): declare bybit_2 spot-margin in routing config`. Read order:

1. `CLAUDE.md`.
2. This entry (skip CP-09; this entry supersedes the operator-action portion).
3. `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`.
4. `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` § 4.4 (now 5 bullets).
5. `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` (post-#455 corrective).

Before opening the T1 PR, run the § 4.4 check (5 bullets) and record under a `## Compliance check` heading. T2's risk-manager rules ship with sensible hardcoded defaults (operator can edit config); they do not consume operator-extracted parameters.

### Live-mode check

✅ no flip away from `live` anywhere in the diff. PR #455 is docs + a notebook deletion. No `src/` or `config/` changes.

### Compliance check (per the now-5-bullet § 4.4)

1. ✅ Refuse-to-trade outside the dispatcher? **No** — diff removes such patterns.
2. ✅ Per-account refusal flag/branch? **No.**
3. ✅ Workflow gate (operator-run notebook / parameter capture)? **No** — diff *deletes* exactly that pattern and adds bullet 3 to § 4.4 to prevent recurrence.
4. ✅ Live-mode invariant: see above.
5. ✅ CI green (lint + scan ×2 + collect + inventory).

## CP-2026-05-07-09-s047-T0-complete — S-047 T0: Bybit spot-margin verification notebook + plan correction (SUPERSEDED in part by CP-10)

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-047 — bybit_2 Spot Margin enablement (live-trading priority sprint).
- **Active milestone:** M5 nominally active; S-047 interleaves as ad-hoc live-trading priority work per `operating-protocol.md` § 3 (milestone types).
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-08-s046-complete`.
- **Branches:** work-PR #452 on `claude/S-047-T0-margin-enable-notebook-xBvbM`; plan-correction PR #453 on `claude/S-047-T0-plan-no-gates-correction`. Trigger-session PRs #450 (S-047 plan + diagnostic notebook) + #451 (ping-PR) auto-merged at session start.
- **Telegram sent:** ping-PR #451 self-merged at session start; this checkpoint commit is the sprint-T0-close ride-along.

### 1. Completed (T0)

- **D1 — `notebooks/operator/enable_bybit_spot_margin.ipynb`** (PR #452 merged): 5-cell read-only Colab notebook that captures `marginMode`, `spotMarginMode`, BTC max-borrow tier, free USDT + free BTC, and any open spot-margin borrow positions on `bybit_2`. Cell 2 stages the Python payload on the VM via SSH stdin (no shell-escape minefield) and runs it with `.env` re-sourced first (the cell-4 fix from `debug_vwap_bybit2.ipynb` — `python3 -c` over SSH does NOT inherit systemd's EnvironmentFile). The notebook does **not** flip the Bybit toggle — that lives on Bybit's servers, not in this repo, so the standard PR → merge → VM-autosync workflow has nothing to copy.
- **`docs/claude/colab-workflows.md`** (PR #452): new row in the existing-operator-notebooks table linking to the Colab open URL on `main` (Rule 7).

### 2. Compliance audit + plan correction (PR #453)

The S-047 plan that auto-merged at session start (#450) described two refuse-to-trade gates **outside** the risk manager:

| § | As merged in #450 | Violation |
|---|---|---|
| T1 D2 | "config/accounts.yaml schema: new `is_leverage` boolean" | An account-level flag future code would consult as `if not is_leverage: refuse`. That branch is a gate. |
| T3 D4 | "`execute.py`: pass `isLeverage=1` when account is margin-enabled. Spot-sell pre-flight bypassed when borrowing." | `if not margin_enabled: refuse` branch in the live order path. |
| § 7 | "T2 must refuse to size any short whose stop distance is closer than `liquidation_buffer_pct × liquidation_distance`." | Phrased as an external hard guardrail rather than a risk-manager parameter. |

`docs/claude/workplan.md` § "Live / dry-run rule" (line 296-302) is the controlling rule:

> *"The dispatcher maintains the **only canonical** live / dry-run switch in the system."*

The operator caught this before any code shipped. PR #453 patched the plan in place: dropped `is_leverage` boolean, replaced T3 D4 with "for `bybit_2` always pass `isLeverage=1` (routing decision based on account identity, not refusal)", moved spot-margin parameters (`max_borrow_btc`, `borrow_fee_apr_pct`, `liquidation_buffer_pct`) into the risk-rule configuration surface, and added a new **§ 5b "Compliance with the one-canonical-gate rule"** that spells out the four invariants every PR in the sprint must respect.

PR #452's cells 3+4 were softened in commit `d3ccec7` (post-PR-open) to drop "T1 cannot start until X / Pause T1 until Y" gating language — the notebook is now framed as informational data collection for T2's risk-manager rules, not a process gate.

### 3. New durable rule installed

Per the operator's directive 2026-05-07:

> *"ALL CODE SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR COMPLIANCE BEFORE IT IS SHIPPED OR ESCALATED TO THE OPERATOR."*

Added `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` § 4.4 "Compliance check before every ship-or-escalate" — minimum check is "no new refuse-to-trade decision outside the risk manager" + "no per-account refusal flag/branch" + the live-mode invariant + green CI. PRs record the check result under a `## Compliance check` heading. The S-047-trigger-session PR #450 is captured in § 4.4 as the cautionary case.

### 4. Files changed across all merged PRs this session

- #450 (auto-merged at session start): `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` (NEW), `notebooks/operator/debug_vwap_bybit2.ipynb` (NEW), `docs/claude/colab-workflows.md` (Rule 7 added).
- #451 (ping-PR, auto-merged): `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl` (one-line append).
- #452 (T0 D1): `notebooks/operator/enable_bybit_spot_margin.ipynb` (NEW), `docs/claude/colab-workflows.md` (one new row).
- #453 (plan correction): `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` (gate language stripped, § 5b added).
- This close-checkpoint commit: `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` (§ 4.4 added), `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry), `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` (S-047 in flight, T0 done, T1 queued).

### 5. Remaining

- **Operator action (exchange-side):** Bybit web UI on `bybit_2` → Account → Margin Mode → **Enable Spot Margin**. Then run the new notebook from Colab, confirm `marginMode=REGULAR_MARGIN` + `spotMarginEnabled=True`, capture the BTC max-borrow tier number for the T1 PR thread.
- **T1 — `feat(accounts): declare bybit_2 spot-margin in routing config`** — can ship in any order relative to the operator's web-UI click; the trader simply doesn't trade margin on `bybit_2` until both sides are present. Per the corrected plan: declare `bybit_2` as a spot-margin account in the existing accounts.yaml routing schema (no new `is_leverage` flag); spot-margin risk parameters land in the risk-rule configuration surface, not as account-level toggles.

### 6. Next session

**S-047 T1 — `accounts.yaml` routing for spot-margin.** Read order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (router).
2. This entry.
3. `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` (current state).
4. `docs/claude/operating-protocol.md` **§ 4.4** (the new pre-ship compliance check).
5. `docs/sprint-plans/S-047-bybit2-spot-margin.md` § 5b (one-canonical-gate compliance) + T1 row.
6. The corrected D2 deliverable spec.

Before opening the T1 PR, run the § 4.4 check and record it in the PR body under `## Compliance check`. Specifically: confirm no `is_leverage` boolean is added; confirm any `bybit_2`-specific routing is declared in the existing routing schema (no new top-level flag); confirm risk parameters go into the risk-rule configuration surface.

### Live-mode check

✅ no flip away from `live` anywhere in this session. Files merged: 5 docs files + 1 notebook. No changes to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, or any live-routing code path.

### Compliance check (per § 4.4 — the rule installed this session)

1. ✅ Does the diff add a refuse-to-trade decision outside the dispatcher? **No.** All edits are docs + a read-only Colab notebook. PR #453 explicitly **removes** unauthorized gate language; PR #452 is read-only diagnostic.
2. ✅ Does the diff add a per-account refusal flag/branch? **No.** PR #453 deletes the proposed `is_leverage` flag and the `if not margin_enabled: refuse` branch from the merged plan.
3. ✅ Live-mode invariant: see above.
4. ✅ All CI green on every merged PR (lint + scan ×2 + collect + inventory).

## CP-2026-05-07-08-s046-complete — S-046 COMPLETE: M4 closed

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-046 — M4 step 3: Janitor audits.
- **Active milestone:** **M4 → CLOSED** this session. **M5 — Strategy testing workflow** queued as next active milestone.
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-07-s046-kickoff`.
- **Branch:** `claude/sprint-planning-status-ZMePk` (work-PR #442). T4 ping-PR pair on `claude/ping-s046-ruff-residuals` (PR #443 DRAFT) + `claude/ping-s046-ruff-residuals-ping` (PR #444 self-merged).
- **Telegram sent:** sprint-complete ride-along on this commit (CHECKPOINT_LOG append → VM ping wiring); sprint-complete row also added to `pending-pings.jsonl` for explicit drain. T4 operator-prompt ping fires through PR #444 merge.

### 1. Completed (T0..T5)

- **T0** — Sprint prompt filed at `docs/sprints/sprint-046-prompt.md` per the 8-section template; kickoff CP prepended; PR #442 opened as DRAFT; sprint-start ping appended.
- **T1** — Dead-file audit (`docs/claude/janitor-2026-05-07-deadfiles.md`); 8 stale files removed: `scripts/verify_deploy.py` + `test_order.py` + `test_order_safe.py` + `test_bybit_connection.py` + `download_bybit_history.py` + `download_data.py` + `run_comparison_backtest.py` + `config.py`. `visualize_swings.py` / `visualize_all.py` deferred.
- **T2** — UI consolidation (`docs/claude/janitor-2026-05-07-ui-consolidation.md`); `src/ui/` shim removed; 11 files rewritten to canonical `src.units.ui.*` path; `tests/test_s032_data_loaders_move.py` deleted (subsumed); `tests/test_s035_folder_reshuffle.py` updated; `grep 'src\.ui\b'` returns 0 hits.
- **T3** — Missing-test audit (`docs/claude/janitor-2026-05-07-missing-tests.md`); `tests/test_units_db_data_loader.py` filed as canonical-path stub for the only gap (`src/units/db/data_loader.py`); 21 of 22 unit modules already had ≥ 1 direct test.
- **T4** — Operator-hold ping-PR pair: PR #443 (DRAFT, work-PR with the 15 mechanical fixes + ruff.toml prune) + PR #444 (self-merged ping-PR with one-line append to `pending-pings.jsonl`). Per CLAUDE.md § Telegram Reporting "Ping-PR vs work-PR separation".
- **T5** — `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-046-summary.md` filed; `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` flipped (M4 → CLOSED, M5 → active, queue refreshed); sprint-complete ping appended; this checkpoint.

### 2. M4 step-3 validation checklist

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| All three audit reports under `docs/claude/janitor-2026-05-07-*.md` | ✅ |
| `src/ui/` no longer exists on disk | ✅ |
| `grep 'from src\.ui'` returns 0 hits | ✅ |
| Every `src/units/<unit>/<module>.py` has ≥ 1 direct test | ✅ |
| `pytest --collect-only -q tests/` collection unchanged from baseline | ✅ (CI green on PR #442) |
| `ruff check .` clean | ✅ |
| `python scripts/secret_scan.py` clean | ✅ |
| `python scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean | ✅ |
| Operator-hold ping-PR pair opened (work-PR DRAFT, ping-PR self-merged) | ✅ (#443 + #444) |
| `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` shows M4 → CLOSED, M5 → active | ✅ |
| Live-mode invariant: no edits to `src/runtime/{orders,pipeline,trading_mode}.py` / `src/units/accounts/*` / `config/accounts.yaml` / `deploy/*` in work-PR (#442) | ✅ |

### 3. Files changed (work-PR #442 only)

5 new files, 12 modified, 12 deleted. Full ledger in `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-046-summary.md` § "Files changed".

### 4. Remaining / Deferred

- **PR #443** (DRAFT, PM review) — operator must approve to land the 15 mechanical ruff fixes. If declined, close the PR; the existing `[lint.per-file-ignores]` block on `main` retains the suppressions.
- **`visualize_swings.py` / `visualize_all.py`** — deferred from T1 (referenced as developer hints in test print statements). Either move under `tools/` or delete in a follow-up Janitor pass.
- **`tests/test_data_loader.py`** — uses the legacy `src.data_layer.*` shim path. Could be migrated to canonical path in a future Janitor pass; out of scope for S-046's "presence-guard" pass.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: **HOLD** (operator hold unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next session

**S-047 — M5 — Strategy testing workflow.** Workplan goals:
1. Telegram-triggered `/test <strategy_name>` command writing a structured request to the repo.
2. Validation logging (signals + decisions + outcomes per workplan § Required logs).
3. Backtest workflow docs (`docs/claude/backtest-workflow.md`) per workplan § Backtesting sessions.

If the operator-hold ping-PR (#443) acceptance reply arrives before S-047 starts, that takes priority — apply the approved fixes to `main` and close the PR.

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched in the work-PR (#442). T4's separate work-PR (#443) touches `src/runtime/pipeline.py` + `src/units/accounts/*` but stays DRAFT pending operator approval per CLAUDE.md § Live-mode invariant rule (3). `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean against `main` for both branches.

## CP-2026-05-07-07-s046-kickoff — S-046 kickoff: M4 step 3 (Janitor audits)

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-046 — M4 step 3: Janitor audits (close M4).
- **Active milestone:** M4 — Repo hygiene + CI (CI suite + conftest + ruff cleanup + auto-sync branch protection ✅; Janitor audits open → this sprint).
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-06-s045-followup-auto-sync` (PRs #439 + #440 merged).
- **Branch:** `claude/sprint-planning-status-ZMePk` (per harness-assigned development branch).
- **Telegram sent:** sprint-start ride-along on this commit (CHECKPOINT_LOG append → VM ping wiring); sprint-start row added to `pending-pings.jsonl` for explicit drain.

### 1. Completed (T0)

- Sprint prompt filed at `docs/sprints/sprint-046-prompt.md` per the 8-section template in `docs/claude/sprint-planning.md`.
- Sprint number S-046 confirmed monotonic: highest used = S-045; post-S-045 follow-up was unnumbered; S-046 is next.
- Unit boundary declared (Janitor sprint: deletions + import rewrites + stub tests; no behaviour changes; T4 ping-PR carries the only operator-hold-path proposal and rides on a separate branch).
- Live-mode invariant: ✅ untouched (`src/runtime/orders.py`, `pipeline.py`, `trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, `config/accounts.yaml`, `deploy/*` all on operator hold for *this* branch).
- Sprint-start ping appended to `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl`.
- This kickoff CP appended; milestone-state to be updated in the same commit.

### 2. Files changed (T0)

- `docs/sprints/sprint-046-prompt.md` (new)
- `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl` (sprint-start row)
- `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` (active sprint pointer + S-046 row)
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry)

### 3. Tests run

- None this checkpoint (docs-only T0). Subsequent checkpoints validate against `pytest --collect-only` and `ruff check .`.

### 4. Remaining (T1..T5)

- **T1** — Dead-file audit: pull `repo-inventory.yml` artifacts from PRs #437..#441, diff, file `docs/claude/janitor-2026-05-07-deadfiles.md`, PR safe deletions.
- **T2** — UI consolidation: pick canonical `src/units/ui/`, fold or delete `src/ui/` (3 files), rewrite `from src.ui import …` callers, file consolidation report.
- **T3** — Missing-test audit: walk `src/units/<unit>/`, list units without `tests/test_<unit>_*.py`, file stubs with one importable assertion each.
- **T4** — Operator-hold ping-PR on `claude/ping-s046-ruff-residuals` (DRAFT work-PR with the 15 mechanical fixes + ruff.toml prune) plus `claude/ping-s046-ruff-residuals-ping` (self-merged ping-PR firing the Telegram notification).
- **T5** — Sprint close: `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-046-summary.md`, `milestone-state.md` flips M4 → CLOSED + M5 → active, sprint-complete ping, final CP.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: **HOLD** (operator hold unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next checkpoint

`CP-2026-05-07-NN-s046-T1-deadfiles` — T1 (dead-file audit + safe deletions PR).

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched. T0 changes confined to `docs/sprints/`, `docs/claude/`. `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean by inspection (no diff under `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, or `config/accounts.yaml`).

## CP-2026-05-07-06-s045-followup-auto-sync — auto-sync branch-protection workflow

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** post-S-045 follow-up (no formal sprint number — janitor improvement on top of S-045's T4 deliverable).
- **Active milestone:** M4 — Repo hygiene + CI (CI suite + conftest + ruff cleanup + auto-sync branch protection ✅; Janitor audits remain → S-046).
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-05-s045-complete`.
- **Telegram sent:** session-end ride-along on this commit.

### 1. Completed

- **PR #439 merged** (squash → `d5b6318`). Replaces the S-045 T4 Colab-notebook flow with a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/branch-protection-sync.yml`) that runs on every push to `main` and on `workflow_dispatch`. The required-status-checks contexts are hardcoded in the workflow's `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` shell variable; to add or remove a check, edit the variable, commit, push.
- Soft-skip on missing secret: if `secrets.BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN` is unset, a preflight step writes `configured=false` to GITHUB_OUTPUT and the actual API call is gated on `if: steps.token_check.outputs.configured == 'true'`. The workflow stays green until the operator does the one-time PAT setup; runs the sync the moment the secret is added.
- Notebook (`notebooks/operator/update_branch_protection.ipynb`) repurposed as the manual fallback. Header + footer markdown cells updated to reflect the new role.
- `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` § "Branch protection wiring" rewritten — auto-sync workflow described first, one-time operator setup spelled out (3 numbered steps), notebook moved to a "Manual fallback" subsection.

### 2. Files changed (PR #439)

- `.github/workflows/branch-protection-sync.yml` — new
- `notebooks/operator/update_branch_protection.ipynb` — modified (header + footer markdown cells)
- `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` — modified
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` — modified (this entry)

### 3. Tests run

- All 5 PR checks green on PR #439 (collect, lint, scan, scan, inventory) — `dry-run-guard` clean.
- `ruff check .` → All checks passed!

### 4. Remaining / Deferred

- **Operator one-time setup for `branch-protection-sync.yml`.** Create a fine-grained PAT scoped to ONLY this repo with `Administration: Read and write`; add as repo secret `BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN`. Until done, the workflow soft-skips with a notice (no red X). Steps in `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` § "One-time operator setup".
- **Operator-hold lint residuals → ping-PR.** 15 mechanical hits suppressed via `[lint.per-file-ignores]` in `ruff.toml`. Same status as S-045 close.
- **`repo-inventory` promotion to blocking** — unchanged.
- **Janitor audits → S-046** — unchanged.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: HOLD (operator hold unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next session

**S-046** — M4 step 3 (Janitor audits): dead-file / duplicate-module (`src/ui/` vs `src/units/ui/`) / missing-test audits. Or M5 — Strategy testing workflow if the operator prioritises strategy validation.

If the operator-hold ping-PR fires before S-046 starts, that takes priority.

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched in any commit on this branch. CI infra + docs only.

### Open PRs at session end

None. PRs #438 (S-045) and #439 (auto-sync follow-up) both merged to `main`.

## CP-2026-05-07-05-s045-complete — S-045 COMPLETE: M4 step 2 done

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-045 — M4 step 2: conftest cleanup, promote `pytest-collect` to blocking, ruff rule expansion.
- **Active milestone:** M4 — Repo hygiene + CI (CI suite + conftest + ruff cleanup ✅; Janitor audits remain → S-046).
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-04-s045-kickoff`.
- **Telegram sent:** sprint-complete ride-along on this commit (CHECKPOINT_LOG append → VM ping wiring).
- **Alerts sent during session:** none.
- **Blockers:** S-015 operator hold (unchanged); BUG-057 awaiting VM diag (unchanged); operator-hold lint residuals tracked for follow-up ping-PR (see § 4).

### 1. Completed (T0..T5)

- **T0** — Sprint prompt filed at `docs/sprints/sprint-045-prompt.md`; kickoff CP prepended; PR #438 opened as draft.
- **T1** — Fixed BUG-062: extended `tests/conftest.py` telegram stub to expose `telegram.error.TelegramError` (real Exception subclass) + `telegram.constants.ChatAction` + `MessageHandler` / `filters` on `telegram.ext`; converted `tests/test_bot_web_sweep.py` `if "fastapi" not in sys.modules:` guard to `try: import fastapi; except ImportError: stub` shape. Added `email-validator>=2.0.0` to `requirements-test.txt`. `pytest --collect-only -q tests/ --ignore=tests/test_main_loop.py` now `2502 collected, 0 errors` (was `1767 collected, 45 errors`).
- **T2** — Dropped `--continue-on-collection-errors` and `|| true` shim from `.github/workflows/pytest-collect.yml`; promoted from advisory → blocking. `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` updated (table + per-workflow section + required-checks list).
- **T3 a..h** — Ruff rule cleanup, one rule per commit. F541 (21 fixes) + E401 (1) + F811 (6) + F841 (11) + F401 (157 across two scoped commits) + E402 (33 noqa annotations) + E741 (13 renames) + F821 (4) + E731 + E701 cleanup. Final `ruff check .` clean on every non-operator-hold path.
- **T3i** — Dropped `--select` from `.github/workflows/ruff-lint.yml`; ruff now runs the default rule set. 15 residual hits in operator-hold paths suppressed via `[lint.per-file-ignores]` in new `ruff.toml` with backlog comment naming the ping-PR.
- **T4** — `notebooks/operator/update_branch_protection.ipynb` filed. PUTs the required-status-checks contexts (`pytest-collect`, `secret-scan`, `ruff-lint`, `dry-run-guard`) via the GitHub API; `repo-inventory` deliberately not in the list. Idempotent.
- **T5** — `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-045-summary.md` filed; `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` refreshed (M4 row + active milestone + recently-closed-milestones rows for S-044 + S-045); this checkpoint.

### 3. Files changed

See `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-045-summary.md` § "Files changed" for the full list. Headline counts:

- 1 new sprint prompt + 1 new sprint summary + 1 new bug-log row + 1 new ruff config + 1 new operator notebook.
- 2 CI workflow files modified (pytest-collect blocking; ruff-lint default rule set).
- 1 test-deps file (`requirements-test.txt`) modified — added email-validator + comment refresh.
- ~95 source/test files touched by the per-rule ruff cleanups (mechanical, behaviour-preserving).
- 1 docs runbook + 1 milestone-state file + 1 checkpoint log modified.

### 4. Remaining / Deferred

- **Operator-hold lint residuals → follow-up ping-PR.** 15 mechanical ruff hits are suppressed via `[lint.per-file-ignores]` in `ruff.toml`:
  - `src/runtime/pipeline.py` × 9 (E402)
  - `src/units/accounts/dxtrade_client.py` × 1 (F401)
  - `src/units/accounts/integrator.py` × 2 (F401)
  - `src/units/accounts/prop_risk.py` × 1 (F401)
  - `src/units/accounts/execute.py` × 2 (F541)

  Per CLAUDE.md § "Telegram Reporting", a follow-up ping-PR will propose the mechanical fixes for operator review. When the operator approves, the corresponding `ruff.toml` entries get removed in the same PR. **This is NOT a blocker for S-045 closure** — the sprint succeeded with the residuals documented and CI green.
- **Branch protection wiring** — operator must run `notebooks/operator/update_branch_protection.ipynb` once after PR #438 merges.
- **`repo-inventory` promotion to blocking** — stays advisory until ≥ 5 PRs have observed the artifact (unchanged from S-044).
- **Janitor audits → S-046.** Dead-file audit (using `repo-inventory.yml` artifact across PRs), duplicate-module audit (`src/ui/` vs `src/units/ui/`), missing-test audit (`src/units/` modules without `tests/test_<unit>_*.py`).
- **`tests/test_backtester.py:test_run_capital_updated`** missing assertion (T3d found `initial = bt.capital` was never compared) — out of scope for janitor sprint.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: **HOLD** (operator hold unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next session

**S-046 — M4 step 3 (Janitor audits).** Or skip ahead to **M5 — Strategy testing workflow** if the operator prioritises strategy validation; the workplan permits either order.

If the operator-hold ping-PR fires before S-046 starts, that takes priority — apply the approved mechanical fixes and prune `ruff.toml`'s ignore table.

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched in any commit on this branch. Diff vs `main` = `tests/`, `src/` (excluding `runtime/{orders,pipeline,trading_mode}.py` and `units/accounts/*`), `scripts/`, `utils/`, top-level entry-point .py files, `notebooks/operator/update_branch_protection.ipynb`, `requirements-test.txt`, `ruff.toml` (new), `.github/workflows/{pytest-collect,ruff-lint}.yml`, `docs/`. `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean. No changes to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, `src/main.py`, `config/accounts.yaml`, or `deploy/`.

## CP-2026-05-07-04-s045-kickoff — S-045 kickoff: conftest cleanup + ruff rule expansion

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-045 — M4 step 2: conftest cleanup, promote `pytest-collect` to blocking, ruff rule expansion.
- **Active milestone:** M4 — Repo hygiene + CI (in progress; CI suite shipped S-044, this sprint closes step 2).
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-03-s044-complete`.
- **Branch:** `claude/sprint-045-conftest-ruff-cleanup-mR5iu`.
- **Telegram sent:** sprint-start ride-along on this commit (CHECKPOINT_LOG append → VM ping wiring).

### 1. Completed (T0)

- Sprint prompt filed at `docs/sprints/sprint-045-prompt.md` — Tier 1, all self-merge, T0..T5 checkpoint table.
- Unit boundary declared (Janitor sprint: mechanical ruff fixes + conftest stub fix; no behaviour changes).
- Live-mode invariant: ✅ untouched (`src/runtime/orders.py`, `pipeline.py`, `trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, `config/accounts.yaml`, `deploy/*` all on operator hold).
- This kickoff CP appended.

### 2. Files changed (T0)

- `docs/sprints/sprint-045-prompt.md` (new — T0)
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry — T0)

### 3. Tests run

- None this checkpoint (docs-only T0).

### 4. Remaining (T1..T5)

- **T1** — Pick option A (install `python-telegram-bot` in `requirements-test.txt` + drop stub) or option B (extend MagicMock stub with `telegram.error.TelegramError`). Verify `pytest --collect-only -q tests/ --ignore=tests/test_main_loop.py` returns 0 errors.
- **T2** — Drop `--continue-on-collection-errors` + `|| true` shim from `.github/workflows/pytest-collect.yml`. Update `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` to flip `pytest-collect` from advisory → blocking.
- **T3** — Ruff rule expansion, one rule per commit: F541 → E401 → F811 → F841 → F401 → E402 → E741 → F821. Final `ruff-lint.yml` drops `--select`.
- **T4** — Branch protection wiring (one-click Colab notebook under `notebooks/operator/` per CLAUDE.md "Always do" rule); required checks: `pytest-collect`, `secret-scan`, `ruff-lint`, `dry-run-guard`.
- **T5** — `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-045-summary.md` + `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` refresh + final CP.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: **HOLD** (operator hold unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next checkpoint

`CP-2026-05-07-NN-s045-T1-conftest-fix` — T1 (`tests/conftest.py` telegram stub fix).

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched. T0 changes confined to `docs/sprints/` and `docs/claude/checkpoints/`.

## CP-2026-05-07-03-s044-complete — S-044 COMPLETE: M4 CI suite shipped

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-044 — M4: Repo hygiene + CI — complete the GitHub Actions CI suite
- **Active milestone:** M4 — Repo hygiene + CI (still in progress; CI suite ✅ done, Janitor + canonical-path remaining → S-045 candidate next).
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-02-s044-kickoff`.
- **Telegram sent:** sprint-complete ride-along on this commit (CHECKPOINT_LOG append → VM ping wiring).
- **Alerts sent during session:** none.
- **Blockers:** S-015 operator hold (unchanged); BUG-057 awaiting VM diag (unchanged).

### 1. Completed (T0..T5)

- **T0** — Sprint prompt filed at `docs/sprints/sprint-044-prompt.md`; kickoff CP prepended.
- **T1** — `.github/workflows/pytest-collect.yml` added. Runs collect-only pytest on PRs against main.
- **T2** — `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` (blocking) + `.github/workflows/repo-inventory.yml` (advisory) added. Inventory uploads a 14-day artifact.
- **T3** — `.github/workflows/ruff-lint.yml` + `requirements-dev.txt` added. Initial rule set `--select E9,F63,F7` (passes on current main); broader rule expansion deferred to S-045 Janitor sprint.
- **T4** — `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` runbook filed.
- **T5** — `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-044-summary.md` filed; `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` refreshed (M4 row + active milestone status); this checkpoint.

### 2. M4 step-1 validation checklist

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| pytest-collect workflow file present + triggers on PR + push to main | ✅ (advisory — deviation from prompt; see § 4) |
| secret-scan workflow file present + uses scripts/secret_scan.py exit code | ✅ |
| repo-inventory workflow file present + uploads artifact + advisory only | ✅ |
| ruff-lint workflow file present + passes on current main with E9/F63/F7 | ✅ |
| ci-status-checks.md runbook documents all 5 PR-gating workflows + branch-protection list | ✅ |
| `python scripts/secret_scan.py` (local) | ✅ Clean |
| `python scripts/repo_inventory.py` (local) | ✅ Junk candidates: none |
| `ruff check . --select E9,F63,F7` (local) | ✅ All checks passed! |
| Unit-boundary check: no `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `deploy/` changes | ✅ |
| `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean against main | ✅ |

### 3. Files changed

- `docs/sprints/sprint-044-prompt.md` (new — T0)
- `.github/workflows/pytest-collect.yml` (new — T1)
- `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` (new — T2)
- `.github/workflows/repo-inventory.yml` (new — T2)
- `.github/workflows/ruff-lint.yml` (new — T3)
- `requirements-dev.txt` (new — T3)
- `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` (new — T4)
- `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-044-summary.md` (new — T5)
- `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` (modified — T5)
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry + T0 entry)

No `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, or `deploy/` changes.

### 4. Remaining / Deferred

- **Branch protection wiring** — operator (or admin-token Claude) must add `secret-scan`, `ruff-lint`, `dry-run-guard` to required status checks on `main` after merge. `pytest-collect` and `repo-inventory` stay advisory pending follow-ups. Steps in `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` § "Branch protection wiring".
- **Conftest.py telegram-stub cleanup → `pytest-collect` promotion to blocking.** First CI run revealed `tests/conftest.py` stubs `telegram` / `telegram.ext` as `MagicMock` without exposing `telegram.error` (the attr `src/bot/comms_handler.py` imports). 45 test files fail collection today. Fixing the stub (or installing `python-telegram-bot` and removing the stub) drops the workflow's `|| true` shim and flips it to blocking. **This was a deviation from the S-044 prompt's success criteria** — the prompt assumed `pytest-collect` would be blocking on first run; the on-disk state didn't match. Verify-before-trusting-done principle applied: shipped advisory + documented deviation rather than mass-edit `tests/conftest.py` outside the unit-boundary declaration. Janitor candidate.
- **Ruff rule expansion** — current `main` carries 286 hits across the broader rule set. S-045 Janitor candidate.
- **`repo-inventory` promotion** — stays advisory until ≥ 5 PRs observed; promotion is its own follow-up.
- **Full pytest in CI** — needs sandbox-safe data layer + market connectors first; separate sprint.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: **HOLD** (operator hold unchanged).
- 5m/1h timeframe enforcement Tier 3 PR: **HOLD** (unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next session

**S-045 — M4 step 2 (Janitor audits) candidate.** Workplan order: dead file audit (using S-044's repo-inventory artifact as a signal), duplicate module audit (`src/ui/` vs `src/units/ui/` — flagged in 2026-05-02 architecture audit), missing test audit (modules in `src/units/` without a `tests/test_<unit>_*.py`). Or skip ahead to **M5 — Strategy testing workflow** if the operator prioritises strategy validation; the workplan permits either order.

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched in any commit on this branch. Diff vs `main` is `.github/workflows/`, `docs/`, and the new top-level `requirements-dev.txt`. `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean. No changes to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, or `config/accounts.yaml`.

## CP-2026-05-07-02-s044-kickoff — S-044 T0: M4 step 1 (CI suite) kickoff

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** S-044 — M4: Repo hygiene + CI — complete the GitHub Actions CI suite
- **Active milestone:** M4 — Repo hygiene + CI (in progress)
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-07-01-bug061-spot-tpsl-blocker` (PR #435 merged) → most recent merged work; `CP-2026-05-06-15-s043-complete` is the prior sprint-close.
- **Telegram sent:** kickoff ride-along on this commit (CHECKPOINT_LOG append → VM ping wiring).
- **Alerts sent during session:** none.
- **Blockers:** S-015 operator hold (unchanged); BUG-057 awaiting VM diag (unchanged).

### 1. Completed

- Verified S-043 closed (M3 done) and PR #435 (BUG-061) merged ✅ — clean main.
- Verified `scripts/secret_scan.py`, `scripts/repo_inventory.py`, `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` all on `main`.
- Confirmed only existing workflows are `dry-run-guard.yml`, `hf-cron.yml`, `training-run.yml` — no overlap with the four new workflows planned this sprint.
- Filed `docs/sprints/sprint-044-prompt.md` with T0..T5 plan, unit-boundary declaration, hard guardrails, and success criteria.
- Confirmed sprint number S-044 follows S-043 with no collision (highest used was S-043; S-036..S-040 burned per workplan rule).

### 2. Files changed (T0)

- `docs/sprints/sprint-044-prompt.md` (new)
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry)

### 3. Tests run

- None this checkpoint — docs-only T0. Workflow runs are validated at T1..T3.

### 4. Remaining (S-044)

- **T1** — Add `.github/workflows/pytest-collect.yml`, verify green on a noop PR.
- **T2** — Add `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` + `.github/workflows/repo-inventory.yml`.
- **T3** — Add `.github/workflows/ruff-lint.yml` + `requirements-dev.txt`.
- **T4** — Add `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md` runbook.
- **T5** — Sprint close: `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-044-summary.md`, `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` M4 row refresh, `CP-2026-05-07-NN-s044-complete` checkpoint.

### 5. Next checkpoint

**CP-2026-05-07-NN-s044-t1-pytest-collect** — Add `.github/workflows/pytest-collect.yml` running `PYTHONPATH=. pytest --collect-only -q tests/` on every PR. Mirror the checkout pattern from `dry-run-guard.yml`. Read order for the next session: this entry → `docs/sprints/sprint-044-prompt.md` § Deliverable 2 → `.github/workflows/dry-run-guard.yml` (template).

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched. T0 is docs-only (sprint prompt + checkpoint append). `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` clean. No changes to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, or `config/accounts.yaml`.

## CP-2026-05-07-01-bug061-spot-tpsl-blocker — BUG-061: Bybit spot Market entries no longer carry stopLoss/takeProfit

- **Session date:** 2026-05-07
- **Sprint:** one-off bug fix (live-trading blocker — operator-paged via @bict_trading_bot)
- **Current sprint phase:** outside the active sprint cadence (S-043 closed at CP-2026-05-06-15)
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-06-15-s043-complete`
- **Next checkpoint:** **CP-2026-05-07-NN** — pick up the next workplan item per `docs/claude/workplan.md` (M4 queued after M3 closed in S-043).
- **Telegram sent:** yes — checkpoint commit on this branch fires the standing VM-side ping wiring.
- **Alerts sent during session:** none beyond the operator's own ping that opened the session.
- **Blockers:** none for this fix. Pre-existing pre-fix test failures (11 in `test_s030_pr4_exchange_modify_close.py` / `test_runtime_orders.py` / `test_orders.py`) verified identical with and without this PR's changes — out of scope and not regressions.

### 1. Completed
- Diagnosed the live-trading blocker: every BTCUSDT-spot `vwap` entry on `bybit_2` rejected by Bybit V5 with `retCode 170130` ("Data sent for parameter '' is not valid"). Liveness watchdog fired ("5 actionable signals fired in the last 1h, but 0 trades landed").
- Confirmed root cause via Bybit V5 docs: `/v5/order/create` only accepts `stopLoss`/`takeProfit` on **Limit** spot orders. The codebase already encoded this restriction in `modify_open_order` (refuses spot, points at the S-030 monitor loop) but the submit paths still passed SL/TP unconditionally for every category.
- Branched on `category` in both `_submit_order` and `_submit_test_order` in `src/units/accounts/execute.py`. Spot Market entries now omit SL/TP; linear/inverse entries keep the quantized SL/TP (BUG-057/BUG-060 contract preserved).
- Added two regression assertions in `tests/test_spot_category_routing.py`: spot omits SL/TP; linear keeps SL/TP.
- Appended BUG-061 row to `docs/claude/bug-log.md`.
- Opened PR #435 as draft, CI green (`scan`), operator approved with "merge and continue" — squash-merged.

### 2. Files changed
- `src/units/accounts/execute.py`
- `tests/test_spot_category_routing.py`
- `docs/claude/bug-log.md`
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry, on the follow-up branch)

### 3. Tests run
- `pytest tests/test_spot_category_routing.py` — 15/15 pass (includes both new BUG-061 assertions).
- `pytest tests/test_order_price_precision.py tests/test_smoke_test_trade.py tests/test_order_refusal.py tests/test_s043_order_refusal_paths.py` — 91/91 pass.
- `python scripts/secret_scan.py` — clean.

### 4. Remaining
- None for the BUG-061 blocker itself. Operator should observe live trades resume on the next `vwap` actionable signal (deploy via the standing `ict-git-sync.timer` → `ict-trader-live.service` restart cycle, ≤ 5 min).
- Follow-up architectural item (filed in BUG-061 Notes): add a Bybit-V5 contract test that constructs the exact payload for each `(category, orderType)` combo and pins which fields are allowed, so future code paths cannot accidentally include disallowed fields.

### 5. Next checkpoint
**CP-2026-05-07-02** — pick up the next workplan item (M4 per `docs/claude/workplan.md`). Read in order: `docs/claude/workplan.md` (decider), `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`, this checkpoint entry, then the M4 sprint planning doc when it's filed.

## CP-2026-05-06-15-s043-complete — S-043 complete: M3 closed, order-layer refusal tests done

- **Session date:** 2026-05-06
- **Sprint:** S-043 — M3: Risk controls foundation — order-layer refusal tests
- **Active milestone:** M3 — Risk controls foundation → **CLOSED** this session. M4 next.
- **Last completed checkpoint:** `CP-2026-05-06-14-s042-complete`.
- **Telegram sent:** sprint-start + sprint-complete pings appended to `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl`.
- **Alerts sent during session:** none.
- **Blockers:** S-015 operator hold (unchanged); BUG-057 awaiting VM diag (unchanged).

### 1. Completed (T0 + T1 + T2 + T3)

**T0 — Sprint start:**
- `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` updated: M3 IN PROGRESS, S-043 active.
- Sprint-start ping appended to `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl`.

**T1 — Refusal-path map + gap list:**
- Audited every refusal path in `src/runtime/orders.py::safe_place_order`
  (13 paths) and `src/units/accounts/risk.py::RiskManager.evaluate` (5 paths).
- Identified gaps: non-dict order input, empty/whitespace symbol, direct
  `evaluate()` (allow, reason) tuple coverage, `account_mode_dry_run` token,
  smoke-test bypass under dry_run mode, halt-flag precedence, and
  exchange-not-called invariants.
- Full table in `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-043-summary.md` § T1.

**T2 — `tests/test_s043_order_refusal_paths.py` filed:**

| Test class | Count | Pin |
|---|---|---|
| `TestPayloadValidationRefusals` | 6 | non-dict, missing/empty/whitespace symbol → "failed_validation" |
| `TestHaltFlagPrecedence` | 3 | halt wins over MAX_POSITION_USD / MAX_QTY / MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS |
| `TestRiskManagerEvaluateReasons` | 7 | (allow, reason) tuple for clean / DAILY_LOSS_CAP / POSITION_SIZE_CAP / INTRADAY_DRAWDOWN + boundary pins |
| `TestEvaluateAccountModeDryRun` | 3 | "account_mode_dry_run" token + precedence + live-default |
| `TestSmokeTestBypass` | 4 | smoke-test bypass beats every gate including dry_run |
| `TestExchangeNotCalledOnRefusal` | 5 | every refusal short-circuits before client.place_order |

**T3 — Sprint close:**
- `docs/claude/milestone-state.md`: M3 CLOSED → M4 queued.
- `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-043-summary.md`: filed.
- Sprint-complete ping appended to `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl`.
- This checkpoint entry.

### 2. M3 validation checklist

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `pytest tests/test_s043_order_refusal_paths.py` | ✅ 28 passed |
| Regression sweep (test_runtime_orders / test_order_refusal / test_per_strategy_risk / test_smoke_test_pipeline) | ✅ No new failures (10 pre-existing tracked, predate this branch) |
| `scripts/secret_scan.py` | ✅ Clean |
| `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py` | ✅ Clean |
| Gap list produced at T1 | ✅ |
| All identified gaps covered at T2 | ✅ 28 new tests across 6 classes |

### 3. Files changed

- `tests/test_s043_order_refusal_paths.py` (new — 28 tests)
- `docs/claude/milestone-state.md` (M3 CLOSED, M4 active, table refreshed)
- `docs/claude/pending-pings.jsonl` (sprint-start + sprint-complete)
- `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-043-summary.md` (new)
- `docs/claude/checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` (this entry)

No source files in `src/` were modified — S-043 is a tests-only sprint.

### 4. Remaining / Deferred

- 10 pre-existing test failures in `test_runtime_orders.py` /
  `test_per_strategy_risk.py` / `test_smoke_test_pipeline.py` reference
  removed `DRY_RUN` / `ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING` env vars (operator directive
  2026-05-03, BUG-039) or hit a MagicMock-numpy isolation issue. These
  predate the branch — verified by running the suite at HEAD~. Tracked
  for an M4 Janitor sprint.
- S-015 pause/continue Tier 2 PR: **HOLD** (operator hold unchanged).
- 5m/1h timeframe enforcement Tier 3 PR: **HOLD** (unchanged).
- BUG-057: awaiting VM `journalctl` output (unchanged).

### 5. Next session

**M4 — Repo hygiene + CI.** Workplan order: Janitor audits, canonical
path enforcement, complete GitHub Actions suite. The pre-existing
legacy-env-var tests are good first cleanup targets.

### Live-mode check

✅ No live-trading code touched. Tests-only PR. `scripts/check_dry_run_in_diff.py`
clean. No changes to `src/runtime/orders.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`,
`src/runtime/trading_mode.py`, `src/units/accounts/*`, or `config/accounts.yaml`.
