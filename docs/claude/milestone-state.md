# Milestone & session state

> **Purpose:** single quick-glance answer to "where is the program right now?"
> for future Claude sessions. Read this **after** `checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_LOG.md`
> (which tells you where to resume tactically) but **before** opening any sprint plan.
>
> **Authority:** `docs/claude/workplan.md` is the decider. This file tracks execution
> state against the workplan's M0..M10 roadmap. When this file conflicts with the
> workplan, the workplan wins.
>
> **Update rule:** the closing checkpoint of every sprint updates this file.
> If the file is stale, the resuming session should refresh it before doing
> any other work.

## How to read this file

1. **Active milestone** — the one milestone currently being worked.
2. **M0..M10 status table** — on-disk-verified status for every milestone.
3. **Recently closed milestones** — last three closed milestones.
4. **Queued milestones** — what's lined up next in workplan order.
5. **Standing / recurring sessions** — auto-task milestones on a cadence.
6. **Open blockers** — anything the operator owes the program.

When opening a session:

- If the **Active milestone** points at a sprint with an open checkpoint, resume
  that checkpoint per `checkpoint-workflow.md`.
- If the **Active milestone** has no open sprint, start the next sprint in its backlog.
- If a **Blocker** is listed, follow the ping-PR pattern in `telegram-pings.md`.

## Active milestone

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Milestone** | M6 — Web app UI (dashboard build-out, sprint E — S-065) |
| **Title** | S-065 — Dashboard sprint E: controls phase 1 (halt + live/dry toggle) + minimal session/login flow |
| **Type** | auto-claude (M6 dashboard UI + first Tier-3 bot mutating endpoints + Tier-2 session). Parent: 5-sprint dashboard plan S-061..S-065 approved by operator on 2026-05-09. |
| **Goal** | Per `docs/sprints/sprint-065-prompt.md` — stand up the minimal email + shared-secret login flow on the dashboard wired to `POST /api/auth/login`; ship the first Tier-3 bot endpoint (halt) gated behind JWT + per-action confirm token; dashboard surfaces a halt button on the Settings tab that's previously read-only. |
| **Status** | 🔜 NEXT 2026-05-09 — S-064 closed (bot prereq PR #597 + bot main PR + dashboard PR all merged). |
| **Active sprint** | **S-065 — Sprint E.** Plan: `docs/sprints/sprint-065-prompt.md`. |
| **Active checkpoint** | (none yet — sprint to be opened by next session) |
| **Risk tier** | Tier 2 (login flow) + Tier 3 (halt control). First sprint that adds risk surface to the dashboard. |
| **Definition of done** | Per `sprint-065-prompt.md` checkpoints. End of the dashboard build-out arc. |

> **S-064 close-out (2026-05-09):** dashboard side ships
> `LiquidityMapsTab` + `SettingsTab` consuming the two new bot Tier-1
> endpoints. Bot side ships in two PRs:
>
> 1. **Prereq PR** (`claude/bot-S-064-prereq-liquidity-state-writer`) —
>    `src/runtime/liquidity_state.py` writes
>    `runtime_logs/liquidity_state.json` per tick from the existing
>    `LiquidityDetector` (which had been unit-tested but never invoked
>    from the runtime). One-line hook from `turtle_soup_signal_builder`
>    + `vwap_signal_builder` after `fetch_candles`. 13 new tests
>    covering pure detection, atomic per-symbol merge, and the
>    no-raise-into-tick-loop contract.
> 2. **Main PR** — `GET /api/bot/liquidity?symbol=X&limit=N` reads
>    that file; `GET /api/bot/config` re-reads YAMLs + overlays the
>    pipeline's runtime live/dry state from `runtime_status.json` with
>    allowlist (accounts) + recursive secret-key denylist (strategy
>    params). 22 new tests across both endpoints, including a
>    secret-redaction battery covering api_key / api_secret / token /
>    signing_key / password / hash / credential field names at any
>    nesting depth. `docs/api-tier-policy.md` + `CLAUDE.md` updated
>    with both routes.
>
> `ict-trading-bot#557` (closed-trades endpoint with pattern
> attribution) is **still open / not started** — Performance tab's
> per-strategy breakdown stays empty until that lands; not blocking
> S-065.

> **Parallel:** S-047 T6 (bybit_2 Spot Margin live smoke + runbook) is still
> the live-trading priority and runs on its own branch. S-061..S-065 do not
> block S-047 T6 — both progress in parallel.

**S-048 (M1 comms audit) status:** ✅ CLOSED (fresh re-issue) on `claude/update-roadmap-status-ZnLM9` — see `docs/audits/M1-comms-audit-2026-05-07-fresh.md`.

**M1 P1-A..D follow-ups status:** ✅ CLOSED 2026-05-08 on `claude/review-roadmap-hIO75`. P1-A (workplan correction) was already landed pre-branch on `update-roadmap-status-ZnLM9`; P1-D (`/new_session` + `/test`), P1-B (stuck-request recovery alerts), P1-C (auto-hourly snapshot timer) all shipped here. P2 hygiene cluster remains filed for a future Janitor sprint per `docs/audits/M1-comms-audit-followups-fresh.md`. **M1 → ✅ CLOSED.**

## M0..M10 status table

> Last verified: 2026-05-08 (S-048 fresh re-issue session — operator-directed
> M1 audit redo with corrections baked in; P1 follow-ups landing same-session
> per operator directive). "Verified" = on-disk artifacts checked before
> accepting any prior "done" label.

| Milestone | Focus | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Workflow foundation | ✅ CLOSED | S0 sprint done; `docs/sprint-summaries/sprint-S0-summary.md` exists; CP-2026-05-06-S0-02 in checkpoint log |
| **M1** | Comms infrastructure | ✅ CLOSED | S-048 fresh audit closed on `claude/update-roadmap-status-ZnLM9`. Audit verdict: PARTIAL, no P0. P1-A (workplan correction) landed there same-session. P1-B (stuck-request recovery alerts), P1-C (auto-hourly snapshot timer), P1-D (`/new_session` + `/test` commands) closed 2026-05-08 on `claude/review-roadmap-hIO75`. P2 hygiene cluster filed for a future Janitor sprint per `docs/audits/M1-comms-audit-followups-fresh.md`. |
| **M2** | Web app source of truth (backend) | ✅ CLOSED | S-013 FastAPI backend (`/api/status`, `/api/pnl`, JWT auth). S-014 added `/api/bot/{stats,logs,positions,signals}` for the Vercel dashboard + CORS middleware keyed to `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN`. Dashboard reachability fix landed 2026-05-07 (Vercel rewrite proxies `/api/bot/*` to the bot, defeats HTTPS→HTTP mixed-content block). M2 formally closed 2026-05-08 alongside the M1 P1-A..D follow-ups — backend work was already shipped, this close-out is paperwork-only (no new code). The diagnostic surface (`/api/diag/*`) is a separate workstream and stays out of M2 scope. |
| **M3** | Risk controls foundation | ✅ CLOSED | S-043 closed 2026-05-06. Order-layer refusal tests now complete (28 new gap-closer tests in `tests/test_s043_order_refusal_paths.py`). Risk engine + kill switch + risk caps + reason-token contract all pinned. |
| **M4** | Repo hygiene + CI | ✅ CLOSED | S-044 (CI suite) ✅; S-045 (conftest + pytest-collect blocking + ruff default) ✅; post-S-045 follow-up (auto-sync branch protection workflow) ✅; S-046 (2026-05-07) closed the three Janitor audits. M4 formally closed. |
| **M5** | Strategy testing workflow | 📋 NOT STARTED (paused) | Telegram-triggered test flow, validation logging, backtest workflow docs not yet built. **Paused** behind S-047 T6. The bot-side dispatch surface for `/test <strategy>` is now in place via M1 P1-D — M5 only needs to wire the artifact consumer. |
| **M6** | Web app UI | 🔄 IN PROGRESS (dashboard repo) | S-014 V1 React/Vite SPA shipped 2026-05-07 in `the-lizardking/ict-trader-dashboard`. **S-015 V2 plan scratched 2026-05-07** per operator. Dashboard connection fix (Vercel rewrite of `/api/bot/*` to bot VPS) landed the same day. **In active session 2026-05-08** on dashboard branch `claude/update-roadmap-status-ZnLM9` — wiring mock-data feeds (equity chart, Active ICT Strategies, Trading Conditions) to live `/api/bot/*` data; positions and signals to follow. |
| **M7** | Strategy review gate | 📋 NOT STARTED | |
| **M8** | Strategy tuning | 📋 NOT STARTED | |
| **M9** | AI / model roadmap | 📋 NOT STARTED | S-005 (model monitor) and S-006 (model registry) built under old framing; formal M9 not started. |
| **M10** | HF / data pipeline | 📋 NOT STARTED | S-004 (training pipeline) built under old framing; formal M10 not started. |

## Queued milestones

In execution order. Each row lists the gating condition to start.

| Order | Milestone / sprint | Type | Gating condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **S-047 T6 — end-to-end live smoke + runbook** (D8) | ad-hoc (live-trading) | None — ready to start. Live smoke needs Bybit web-UI Spot Margin toggle ON for `bybit_2`. |
| 2 | **S-047 T7 — sprint close** (milestone-state + bug-log + summary) | docs-only (Tier 1) | T6 closes. |
| 3 | M5 — Strategy testing workflow | auto-claude | S-047 closes. `/test <strategy>` bot-side dispatch surface now in place via M1 P1-D; M5 wires the artifact consumer. |
| 4 | M6 — Web app UI (dashboard repo) | auto-claude | **In active session 2026-05-08** in `the-lizardking/ict-trader-dashboard`. |
| 5 | M9 — AI / model roadmap | auto-claude | Independent of M5/M6. Could run in parallel. |
| 6 | M10 — HF / data pipeline | auto-claude | Independent of M5/M6. Could run in parallel. |
| 7 | **S-050-followup — Phase-3 HTF reference 4h → 1h EMA-200** (Tier 2, PM-review) | strategy-improvement | ≥ 30 days of Phase-2 live metrics on the HTF gate (S-050 shipped 2026-05-09). Expected +0.4 Sharpe lift on top of Phase-2 per V3 in `experiments/2026-05-08-all-models-training/`. |

> M2 (Web app source of truth) — closed 2026-05-08 (paperwork-only;
> backend had already shipped under S-013 + S-014). Not a blocker for
> any queued milestone.
>
> S-050 (VWAP Phase 2 HTF gate) — shipped early on 2026-05-09 via PR
> #558 after the 2026-05-08 all-models training run showed the
> 38-month baseline was structurally unprofitable (Sharpe -0.39).
> The originally-gated "≥ 30 days live metrics" condition was
> waived by operator decision — Phase-2 was no longer a quality
> lift but the difference between profitable and not. The 30-day
> gate now applies to the Phase-3 follow-up instead (HTF reference
> 4h → 1h EMA-200).

## Update protocol

The closing checkpoint of every sprint must:

1. Refresh **Active milestone** (status, active sprint, active checkpoint).
2. If the milestone closed, move it to **Recently closed milestones** and advance
   the next queued milestone into **Active**.
3. Update **M0..M10 status table** for any changed milestones.
4. Refresh the **Queued milestones** rolling window (1–3 ahead).
5. Add or remove **Open blockers** rows as state changes.
6. Commit this file alongside the `CHECKPOINT_LOG.md` append in the same PR so
   the program's state moves atomically.

If a session discovers this file is out of date relative to `CHECKPOINT_LOG.md`,
the first action of the session is to reconcile the two.
