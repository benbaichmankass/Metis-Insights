# Architecture — Canonical (v2)

> **Status:** Canonical. Adopted in sprint **S-CANON-1** (2026-05-10).
> **Repo:** `benbaichmankass/ict-trading-bot`.
> **Authority:** This document supersedes the older
> [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) and the architecture
> sections of the root `CLAUDE.md`. When this doc and an older note
> disagree, this doc wins.
> **Companion:** [`CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md`](CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md)
> covers Claude's operating rules; this doc covers system design only.
> **AI scope:** AI-specific architecture (data → feature → model →
> orchestration → deterministic control) is documented in
> [`architecture/ai-model-platform.md`](architecture/ai-model-platform.md)
> and is owned by ROADMAP.md milestones M9 + M10. When that doc and
> this one overlap on AI scope, the AI-platform doc wins for AI-only
> design questions; this doc remains canonical for system-wide design.

## Purpose

Canonical description of how the ICT trading bot project is structured
and how the major systems work together. Process policy lives in the
rules doc; this doc is system design.

Update this doc whenever real repo architecture changes, when subsystems
are introduced or moved, or when a sprint discovers that the docs no
longer match the implementation.

## Architectural Principles

- Live trading stability takes precedence over feature growth.
- The trader runs 24/7 in YAML-declared mode; the system never
  switches itself off. (Operator-facing rule:
  [`CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md`](CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md) § Prime
  Directive. Code-level contract: § Mode Mutation Contract below.)
- Research, staging, and live trading must remain clearly separable.
- Operator communications must remain isolated from core trading logic.
- Deployment behavior must be explicit and documented.
- Every production-critical subsystem must have a clear owner file
  path, validation path, and logging path.
- Duplicate files, unclear canonical entrypoints, and undocumented side
  effects are architecture problems and are treated as such.

## Mode Mutation Contract (2026-05-12)

The per-account live/dry mode is governed by exactly one contract
from 2026-05-12 onward. See
[`CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md`](CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md) § Prime
Directive for the operator-facing rule; this section is the
system-design counterpart.

1. **Source of truth.** `config/accounts.yaml` `mode:` per account.
   `_resolve_mode(cfg, name)` in `src/units/accounts/__init__.py`
   reads it on every call.
2. **Only mutation path.** The `set-account-mode` operator action
   (`scripts/ops/set_account_mode.sh`, allowlisted in
   `.github/workflows/system-actions.yml`, landed in PR #978).
   Edits YAML, restarts the trader, Telegram-pings the operator with
   the diff via `scripts/ops/notify_run.sh`.
3. **No runtime override layer (deleted).** The `_DRY_RUN_OVERRIDES`
   dict and `set_account_dry_run()` function in
   `src/units/accounts/__init__.py` (+ the
   `Coordinator.set_account_dry_run()` wrapper) **were deleted** in the
   2026-06-10 dead-code cleanup — they had no remaining automatic or
   operator caller once the breaker auto-flip and the legacy Telegram
   `/accounts dry|live` writer (#1933) were retired and all mode flips
   routed through the sanctioned `set_account_mode.sh` (item 2). There
   is no in-memory override layer: `_resolve_mode()` reads
   `config/accounts.yaml` `mode:` directly on every call. A regression
   test asserts their absence
   (`tests/test_exchange_rejection_circuit_breaker.py` —
   `assert not hasattr(_acc, "set_account_dry_run")` /
   `_DRY_RUN_OVERRIDES`).
4. **No auto-flip (verified).** No code path inside `src/` flips a mode.
   The 2026-05-12 silent-flip incident drove this: the breaker auto-flip
   that lived in `src/core/coordinator.py` ("3 consecutive exchange
   rejections → set_account_dry_run(True)") **has been removed** — the
   consecutive-rejection path at `src/core/coordinator.py:1669-1689` now
   only pushes a critical Telegram alert ("Account stays live —
   investigate and use set-account-mode") and never mutates mode. The
   rejection counter remains as RiskManager input only.
5. **Transient issues route through RiskManager.** When exchange
   rejections cluster, data quality degrades, or risk signals
   trip, `RiskManager.approve()` returns
   `reject(reason=…, trade=…)` for an individual trade. The account
   mode is never touched. The next signal is evaluated fresh.
6. **Every rejection is its own Telegram ping.** Per-trade:
   account, symbol, side, qty, reason, raw exchange error if any.
   Not aggregate. The operator sees each refusal as it happens so
   they can intervene fast.
7. **Boot always starts the trader live (per YAML).** `src/main.py`
   reads `accounts.yaml`, resolves modes, and starts ticking. No
   refuse-to-start logic. If state is inconsistent vs. YAML, log
   loudly and Telegram-alert — but the trader runs.
8. **Mechanically enforced.** CI guards (`dry-run-guard.yml` plus the
   follow-on safeguards-PR rule) block new code from writing to
   account modes outside the sanctioned wire.

The operator's account-mode surface is the menu-driven kill switch in
`src/bot/telegram_query_bot.py` (the 2026-05 bot overhaul, #1933): a
confirmed flip persists by invoking `scripts/ops/set_account_mode.sh`
— the sanctioned writer — so there is exactly one on-disk mutation
surface. The legacy `/accounts dry|live <name>` command, which wrote
the in-memory `_DRY_RUN_OVERRIDES` dict, was removed in #1933; the
override dict + `set_account_dry_run()` themselves remain queued for
deletion (item 3 above).

## System Layers

### 1. Runtime trading layer
Market-driven execution behavior:
- market-data intake (`src/exchange/`, `src/runtime/market_data.py`),
- strategy evaluation (`src/units/strategies/`),
- runtime pipeline orchestration (`src/runtime/pipeline.py`,
  entrypoint via `src/main.py`),
- order construction and validation (`src/runtime/orders.py`,
  `src/runtime/validation.py`),
- per-account risk gating (`src/units/accounts/risk.py`,
  `src/units/accounts/prop_risk.py`,
  `src/runtime/risk_counters.py`),
- broker execution (`src/units/accounts/execute.py`),
- runtime logs and state outputs (`runtime_logs/`, `trade_journal.db`).

### 2. Research and validation layer
Idea generation, backtesting, dry-run qualification:
- `notebooks/`,
- `experiments/`,
- `src/backtest/`,
- `ml/` (model training, datasets, registry, manifests — see [`architecture/ai-model-platform.md`](architecture/ai-model-platform.md)),
- backtest dispatch from `src/bot/test_strategy_consumer.py`
  (auto-consumed `test_strategy:<name>` requests).

### 3. Operator control and communication layer
Asynchronous Claude ↔ operator channel:
- repo-backed request artifacts (`comms/requests/`),
- archive (`comms/archive/`),
- schemas (`comms/schema/{request,response}.schema.json`),
- bot polling and writeback (`src/bot/comms_handler.py`,
  `src/bot/telegram_query_bot.py`,
  `src/comms/{models,state,store,templates,log}.py`).

### 4. Deployment and environment layer
Repo sync, services, timers, and runtime application of repo changes:
- systemd unit files in `deploy/`,
- deploy scripts in `scripts/` and `scripts/ops/`,
- environment scaffolding (`.env.example`,
  `scripts/render_env_from_master.py`,
  `config/master-secrets.template.yaml`),
- VM bootstrap (`scripts/vm_bootstrap.sh`),
- web API self-heal (`scripts/ops/restart_web_api.sh`,
  `.github/workflows/vm-web-api-recover.yml`).

### 5. Governance and documentation layer
Canonical docs, sprint logs, roadmap, audits, workflow docs, evidence
trails (`docs/`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CLAUDE.md` root pointer).

## End-to-End Trade Pipeline

The trade pipeline is implemented in `src/runtime/pipeline.py` and
driven from `src/main.py`. The intended sequence is summarised below;
the **canonical step-by-step map**, with files, inputs/outputs, and
failure modes for every stage, lives in
[`TRADE-PIPELINE.md`](TRADE-PIPELINE.md). The dashboard's **Trade
Process** tab fetches that document at runtime — keep it current.

### Step 1 — Market data intake
Exchange connectors (`src/exchange/bybit_connector.py`,
`src/exchange/binance_connector.py`,
`src/exchange/ib_connector.py::IBMarketData`) and the market-data helpers
in `src/runtime/market_data.py` produce candles and tick state. The bot is
**multi-symbol**: `connector_for_symbol(symbol)` routes each symbol to the
right data source by its `config/instruments.yaml` exchange — BTCUSDT →
Bybit; MES (CME) / MGC + MHG (COMEX) → Interactive Brokers (delayed
futures bars via `reqHistoricalData`, no paid real-time subscription).
See `docs/runbooks/ib-integration.md`.

### Step 2 — Strategy evaluation
Strategy modules in `src/units/strategies/` consume market data and emit
signals. The roster has **12 strategies registered** in
`config/strategies.yaml` (verified 2026-06-10). Each declares a
`symbols:` list and is **scoped to it** by the per-strategy symbol gate
(`intent_multiplexer._collect_intents`, 2026-06-02): a strategy is skipped
on any tick symbol not in its `symbols:` — so a strategy no longer
"evaluates every configured symbol each tick" (the earlier MES-mirror
behaviour is intentionally retired). Current roster, by instrument:
- **Crypto (BTCUSDT):** `turtle_soup`, `trend_donchian`, `ict_scalp_5m`,
  `fvg_range_15m`, `htf_pullback_trend_2h` (all `execution: live`);
  `fade_breakout_4h`, `squeeze_breakout_4h` (`execution: shadow` —
  DEMOTED live→shadow 2026-06-01); `vwap` (`enabled: false` — M7
  kill, no net-of-fee edge); `trend_donchian_1h` (`enabled: false` —
  retired, config adopted into `trend_donchian`).
- **Index/metals futures (IBKR `ib_paper`, paper money):**
  `mes_trend_long_1d` (MES), `mgc_pullback_1d` (MGC),
  `mhg_pullback_1d` (MHG) — all `execution: live`, validated params
  per the 2026-06-02 WS-A metals sleeve.

Each strategy carries a per-strategy `execution: live | shadow` gate in
`config/strategies.yaml` (S9, 2026-05-24): `live` is eligible to execute;
`shadow` runs + LOGS order packages everywhere (data collection) but never
sends a live order. The separate per-strategy `enabled:` flag is the
"does it run at all" switch (an explicit operator decision when set
false). Strategy logic is kept separate from broker execution. The full
per-strategy gate/symbol matrix is sourced from `config/strategies.yaml`
and surfaced on `/api/bot/strategies`; the Change log below records each
promotion/demotion.

### Step 3 — Strategy output normalization & the decider (intent aggregation)
Signals are normalised to the internal order/intent representation used
by the runtime pipeline. The runtime audit logger
(`src/utils/signal_audit_logger.py`) writes
`runtime_logs/signal_audit.jsonl` for every decision.

The execution layer holds **one net position per symbol per account**
(`src/runtime/intents.py::aggregate_intents`), so a single account running
several strategies already routes every tick through a **decider** — today
crude: static priority (highest-priority strategy wins a conflict;
same-direction takes max `target_qty`). This is the **single-account
design** (operator direction 2026-05-24): one pot of capital used
maximally — NOT a per-strategy capital split — with the decider
concentrating the fund on the highest-probability trade each tick.
bybit_1 (demo) and bybit_2 (live) are mirrors (same roster, same decider,
same gates); MES is a separate IBKR book, not a redundant split of the
crypto fund. **Decider-v2** (research) makes the selection smart
(regime-rule or selection-model, highest P(profit)) once ≥2 members are
live — a naive greedy decider lets the high-frequency 2h trend hog the
book and forfeits ~half the blend's return + diversification, so v2's job
is genuine selection. Design + single-account simulation:
[`docs/sprint-plans/DECIDER-SINGLE-ACCOUNT-2026-05-24.md`](sprint-plans/DECIDER-SINGLE-ACCOUNT-2026-05-24.md).
The decider remains research-stage — no live simulator script is wired
yet; research harnesses live under `scripts/research/`.

### Step 4 — Risk gating
Before any order reaches broker execution, risk controls decide whether
to allow the signal:
- `RiskManager.approve()` in `src/units/accounts/risk.py` (per-account
  caps: `pos_size`, `daily_usd`, `max_dd_pct`),
- prop-account logic in `src/units/accounts/prop_risk.py`,
- runtime counters in `src/runtime/risk_counters.py`,
- the kill-switch flag (`HALT_FLAG_PATH = /tmp/trader_halt.flag`,
  consumed in `pipeline.py`),
- news veto via `src/news/news_pipeline.py`.

Post-Mode-Mutation-Contract (2026-05-12, see § above): the
RiskManager is also the place that consumes runtime-distress signals
(exchange rejection clusters, etc.) and refuses individual trades for
cause. Account mode is never touched as a side effect of a rejection;
the trader stays live and the next signal is evaluated fresh.

### Step 5 — Runtime order validation
`src/runtime/orders.py::safe_place_order` validates quantities, sizing,
and execution prerequisites. Hard refusal paths exist for invalid or
disallowed orders. Closed-flat invariant lives in
`src/runtime/closed_flat_invariant.py`.

### Step 6 — Broker execution
Only after the steps above does the broker-specific executor send a
live order or simulate one in dry-run mode. `execute._submit_order`
dispatches per account exchange — Bybit (`pybit`) for BTCUSDT, the
`interactive_brokers` branch (`IBClient.place`, `src/units/accounts/ib_client.py`)
for MES futures (native bracket: market entry + TP limit + SL stop, prices
snapped to the 0.25 tick grid; IB uses no API keys — auth is the Gateway
login session). A symbol→exchange dispatch
gate in `src/core/coordinator.py` ensures a BTCUSDT signal can never
route to a futures account and vice-versa. Per-account dry/live mode
is set in `config/accounts.yaml` (`mode: live | dry_run`) and is the
only canonical execution gate; the **only** sanctioned mutation path
for that field is the `set-account-mode` operator action (§ Mode
Mutation Contract). The real-money `ib_live` account is held
`mode: dry_run`; the `ib_paper` account runs `mode: live` (paper
money) and went **live for MES on 2026-05-22**. NOTE (2026-05-24):
the IBKR account is currently **offline pending new-user approval**,
so MES is not executing right now even though the config still
declares it live — the data, edge, and cross-asset diversification
(corr 0.009 vs the BTC book) are validated and
`data/SPX500_1m.parquet` (1m S&P 500, 2020–2026, Dukascopy) is cached
on the trainer, so only the broker login waits. **IBKR is the futures
broker** (a Tradovate sleeve was evaluated and retired; its dead wiring
was purged 2026-06-10). **OANDA v20** joined as the FX/metals broker in
M15 Phase 2 (2026-06-10, S-M15-PHASE2-OANDA): an `oanda` branch in
`execute._submit_order` dispatches to
`src/units/accounts/oanda_client.py::OandaClient` (market order with
broker-side `stopLossOnFill`/`takeProfitOnFill`; one bearer token +
account id from env — `OANDA_API_TOKEN`/`OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID`, practice
host unless `OANDA_ENV=live`). The `oanda_practice` account went **live-on-practice
2026-06-11** (operator-approved; paper money — fxpractice host):
`xauusd_trend_1h` executes practice orders with broker-side
`stopLossOnFill`/`takeProfitOnFill`. Real-money OANDA remains gated
(new keys + `OANDA_ENV=live` + set-account-mode). Runbook:
`docs/runbooks/oanda-integration.md`. **Alpaca** joined as the
US stocks/ETFs broker in M15 Phase 2b (2026-06-11): an `alpaca` branch
dispatches to `src/units/accounts/alpaca_client.py::AlpacaClient`
(**bracket** market orders — entry + TP limit + SL stop atomic; key pair
`ALPACA_API_KEY_ID`/`ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY`; paper host unless
`ALPACA_ENV=live`). The `alpaca_paper` account went **live-on-paper 2026-06-11**
(operator-approved): `spy_trend_long_1d` / `qqq_trend_long_1d` /
`gld_pullback_1d` execute paper bracket orders during the US session
(builders gate on `market_hours.is_market_open("us_equity")`).
Real-money Alpaca remains gated (new keys + `ALPACA_ENV=live` +
set-account-mode). Runbook: `docs/runbooks/alpaca-integration.md`.

### Step 7 — Logging and state updates
The runtime records:
- structured signal audit (`runtime_logs/signal_audit.jsonl`),
- pipeline outcomes (`src/runtime/outcomes.py`),
- heartbeat (`runtime_logs/heartbeat.txt`, refreshed every
  `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default 60s),
- runtime status (`runtime_logs/status.json`),
- trades and order packages (SQLite `trade_journal.db`).

### Step 7.1 — External liveness watchdog (2026-05-11)
The heartbeat file is also watched externally by
[`ict-liveness-watchdog.{service,timer}`](../deploy/), a separate
systemd unit that runs `scripts/check_heartbeat.py` every 60 s.
This is the per-minute dead-man switch on top of the in-process
heartbeat:

- Telegram `[CRITICAL] Trader heartbeat stale` after 5 min of
  stale mtime.
- Autoheal: after 3 consecutive stale checks (~8 min total stall),
  the watchdog dispatches `sudo -n systemctl restart ict-trader-live.service`
  and Telegrams the systemctl exit code. Opt-in via
  `--auto-restart-after N` (currently ON with N=3).
- Boot-grace (`--boot-grace-seconds 600`, 2026-05-28): for the first
  10 min after a host boot the watchdog suppresses the stale/missing
  alert AND autoheal (the trader is expected to be starting under
  systemd) and emits no "recovered" ping — so a VM reboot yields only
  the reboot-vm ping, not heartbeat-stale/recovered spam. Uptime read
  from `/proc/uptime`, fail-open (never suppresses a real post-boot
  stall). A heartbeat still stale once the window closes alerts as a
  genuine failure-to-recover.
- Stdlib-only — runs even when the trader's venv is wedged.
- Full operator runbook: [`docs/runbooks/liveness-watchdog.md`](runbooks/liveness-watchdog.md).

Distinct from `ict-heartbeat.{service,timer}`, which is the
once-daily operator status digest at 13:00 UTC.

The watchdog *restarts* the trader — it does not change the account
mode, and the Mode Mutation Contract does not regulate it. Restarts
are expected and safe; the Prime Directive forbids only the
mode-flip part of an automated response.

### Step 8 — Operator visibility and control
The Telegram bot (`src/bot/telegram_query_bot.py`) plus the FastAPI
diag surface (`src/web/api/routers/diag.py`) expose status, halt and
resume actions, and pending requests. The Streamlit dashboard
(`ict-trader-dashboard`, Streamlit Community Cloud — the React+Vercel
stack was retired 2026-05-12) consumes the unauthenticated Tier 1
endpoints documented in [`api-tier-policy.md`](api-tier-policy.md).

## Research and Validation Pipeline

1. **Concept generation** — notes / Colab notebooks / exploratory
   backtests in `notebooks/`.
2. **Backtest harness** — `src/backtest/` and dispatched runs via
   `scripts/run_backtest.sh`.
3. **Multi-symbol / multi-timeframe validation** — `experiments/`.
4. **Evidence capture** — `experiments/<sprint>/results/*.json` and
   `runtime_logs/validation.jsonl`.
5. **Repo port** — strategy modules under `src/units/strategies/`,
   wired into `config/strategies.yaml`.
6. **Dry-run / staging** — per-account `mode: dry_run` in
   `config/accounts.yaml`, mutated only via `set-account-mode`.
7. **Promotion decision** — Tier 3, requires explicit operator approval.

## Operator Communication Pipeline

The flow is repo-driven and auditable.

### Flow
1. Claude writes a structured request artifact in `comms/requests/`.
2. The VM pulls (`ict-git-sync.timer`, default 5min interval).
3. The Telegram bot detects pending requests and sends them.
4. Operator answers in Telegram (button, "Other" + text, or free text).
5. Bot writes the answer back, sets `status` to
   `answered` / `partially_answered`, and commits.
6. The VM pushes; Claude reads on the next sync.

### Required properties
- isolated from trading logic (no `src/runtime/` or `src/units/` code
  imports `src.comms`),
- atomic file writes (tmp + rename),
- idempotent and safe on restart,
- resistant to duplicate sends,
- resilient to malformed files (unknown `schema_version` is rejected),
- documented for a non-technical operator
  ([`comms/README.md`](../comms/README.md)).

### State model
Statuses: `pending`, `sent`, `partially_answered`, `answered`,
`acknowledged`, `expired`, `cancelled`. Stuck-request alert and
final pre-expiry alert (M1 P1-B) prevent silent expiry.

## Deployment and Sync Pipeline

### Flow
1. Changes merge to `main` on `benbaichmankass/ict-trading-bot`.
2. `ict-git-sync.service` (triggered by `ict-git-sync.timer`, every
   5 min) pulls into `/home/ubuntu/ict-trading-bot` (the working tree).
3. `/opt/ict-trading-bot` is a symlink to the working tree, created by
   `scripts/deploy_diag.sh` on first run.
4. Services reload as designed
   (`ict-trader-live`, `ict-web-api`, `ict-telegram-bot`).
5. Logs in `runtime_logs/` and journalctl confirm whether the update
   applied cleanly.
6. Operator-driven actions go through
   `.github/workflows/system-actions.yml`
   (allowlisted: `status-check`, `pull-latest-logs`, `pull-and-deploy`,
   `restart-bot-service`, `reboot-vm`, `set-account-mode`, plus
   env-toggle and tunnel actions; full list in
   [`claude/system-actions.md`](claude/system-actions.md)).

Recovery is one deterministic daily `docker restart` (**06:05 UTC**, retimed 2026-07-02 from 05:30 — the earlier time was inside IBKR's own ~03:45–05:45 UTC reset window and raced the outage it existed to fix, BL-20260623-002; gated to the gateway VM by `ConditionPathExists=/etc/ict/ib-gateway-docker.env`), **plus** the reactive ~5-min `ict-ib-gateway-watchdog.{service,timer}` (re-armed 2026-06-22, catches a mid-day wedge the daily reset alone would miss; carries `--suppress-window-utc 03:45-05:45` so it never restarts inside IBKR's own reset window either).

## Data Persistence Model (canonical store)

Adopted S-PERSIST-CANON (2026-05-23). Every piece of data the system
produces — on the LIVE trader VM and the TRAINER VM — is persisted into
one central, canonical store that is browsable from the dashboard's
**Data Explorer**. The store is federated across two SQLite files on the
OCI block volume (`/data/bot-data`):

| DB | Producer | Tables | Path resolver |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trade_journal.db` | LIVE trader | `trades`, `order_packages`, `signals` (dual-write, gated by `SIGNAL_DUAL_WRITE_DISABLED`), `backtest_results` (on-demand `/test` runs only), `daily_risk_state`, `strategy_versions` | `src.utils.paths.trade_journal_db_path()` (Python) / `scripts/ops/_lib.sh::runtime_db_path` (shell) |
| `trainer_store.db` | TRAINER (ingested) | `training_cycle`, `dataset_builds`, `db_pulls`, `model_registry`, `experiment_runs`, `backtest_sweeps` | `src.utils.paths.trainer_store_db_path()` |

**Single canonical DB-path resolver.** Both DB paths resolve env-first
(`TRADE_JOURNAL_DB` / `TRAINER_STORE_DB`) → `$DATA_DIR/<file>` →
repo-root, and are **never** a CWD-relative basename. The historical
`os.environ.get("TRADE_JOURNAL_DB") or "trade_journal.db"` idiom resolved
relative to each process's working directory, so any process that started
without the systemd env wrote a fresh DB under its CWD — that is how the
stray duplicate journals appeared on the live VM
(`/home/ubuntu/ict-trading-bot/trade_journal.db`, `…/src/bot/…`). The
`canonical-db-resolver` CI guard (`scripts/check_canonical_db_resolver.py`)
forbids both the CWD-relative fallback and inline `TRADE_JOURNAL_DB`
env-reads outside the resolver, in both shell wrappers and Python.

**Trainer data flow.** The trainer VM rsyncs its JSONL/JSON telemetry
into `runtime_logs/trainer_mirror/` on the live VM
(`scripts/ops/publish_trainer_mirror.sh`). `src/units/db/trainer_store.py`
ingests that mirror into `trainer_store.db` — an idempotent full rebuild,
lazily triggered (mtime-gated) on each Data Explorer read, so the sidecar
is always fresh without a dedicated timer. The sidecar is read-mostly and
deliberately separate from `trade_journal.db` so ingest never contends
with the 24/7 trader. The pre-existing file-based endpoints
(`/api/bot/ml/*`, `/api/bot/backtests/sweeps`) remain; the sidecar makes
the same data SQL-queryable in one place.

**`daily_risk_state` is self-healing.** `RiskManager` rebuilds today's
per-account `daily_pnl` (summed from `trades`) and equity high (from
`runtime_logs/balance_snapshots.json`) on init and on every gate check,
then persists. Before this, `record_trade_result()`/`update_equity()` had
no runtime callers, so the table stayed empty and the daily-loss /
max-drawdown caps reset to 0 on every restart (and never accumulated).

## GitHub Actions and Automation Layer

GitHub Actions are part of the architecture, not a side note.
The canonical reference is
[`docs/github-actions-workflows.md`](github-actions-workflows.md). It
catalogues every workflow under `.github/workflows/` with trigger,
purpose, secrets, outputs, and the rules for when Claude may modify it.

Current workflows include CI guards (`pytest-collect`, `ruff-lint`,
`secret-scan`, `dry-run-guard`, `env-gate-guard`,
`silent-empty-guard`), VM ops (`system-actions`, `vm-diag-snapshot`,
`vm-web-api-recover`, `vm-net-diag`, `vm-net-fix`, `vm-cloud-fix`),
training (`training-run`, `training-rerun-5m`, `hf-cron`),
inventory/labels (`repo-inventory`, `bootstrap-labels`,
`branch-protection-sync`), and the autonomous follow-on driver
(`continue-work`).

## AI-traders training workflow (separate from live trading)

Live trading is fully deterministic — no model is in the live
path. The AI-traders training pipeline is a **separate concern**
that produces research-only baselines under `ml/`. Operator-driven
training sessions follow the established workflow:

1. **Collect feedstock.** The autonomous `/performance-review` skill
   (split out of `/health-review` 2026-05-26) emits per-decision
   `trade_decision_grades[]` for every order package since the last
   review and persists each one — keyed by `order_package_id` — to
   [`comms/claude_strategy_scores.jsonl`](../comms/claude_strategy_scores.jsonl)
   (the durable, repo-tracked score log; supersedes the older
   `comms/claude_trade_scores.jsonl` keyed by `trade_id`, which carried
   no real rows). These labelled grades flow into the `trade_outcomes`
   family
   ([`ml/datasets/families/trade_outcomes.py`](../ml/datasets/families/trade_outcomes.py))
   and the `setup_labels` family
   ([`ml/datasets/families/setup_labels.py`](../ml/datasets/families/setup_labels.py))
   as their primary label source.
2. **Build datasets.** `python -m ml.datasets build <family>` writes
   versioned artifacts under `<output>/<family>/<scope>/<tf>/<version>/`
   with mandatory metadata + leakage discipline. Buildable families:
   `trade_outcomes`, `backtest_results`, `market_raw`,
   `market_features`, `setup_labels`. Family taxonomy:
   [`docs/data/dataset-taxonomy.md`](data/dataset-taxonomy.md).
3. **Train baselines.** `python -m ml train <manifest>` runs a YAML
   manifest end-to-end (split → fit → evaluate → register). Established
   manifests:
   - [`ml/configs/retired/baseline-trade-outcome-winrate.yaml`](../ml/configs/retired/baseline-trade-outcome-winrate.yaml)
     (WS5-A; per-strategy historical winrate). **Retired from the daily cycle
     2026-06-28** — an intentionally-trivial demo baseline whose `f1=0` is
     by-construction on a sub-50%-win-rate holdout; runnable ad hoc. See
     [`ml/configs/retired/README.md`](../ml/configs/retired/README.md).
   - [`ml/configs/retired/baseline-trade-outcome-global.yaml`](../ml/configs/retired/baseline-trade-outcome-global.yaml)
     (WS4-FU; global-mean sanity baseline). **Retired from the daily cycle
     2026-06-28** alongside its winrate twin (same by-construction `f1=0`).
   - [`ml/configs/baseline-regime-classifier.yaml`](../ml/configs/baseline-regime-classifier.yaml)
     (WS5-B-PART-2; 2-class range/volatile regime classifier on `market_features`).
   - [`ml/configs/baseline-setup-quality.yaml`](../ml/configs/baseline-setup-quality.yaml)
     (WS5-C; setup-quality scorer on `setup_labels`).
4. **Compare runs.** `python -m ml compare <id-a> <id-b>` surfaces
   shared-metric deltas as JSON.
5. **Promotion is gated past shadow.** Since 2026-05-19 every
   baseline manifest declares `target_deployment_stage: shadow` and
   `_DEFAULT_STAGE` is `shadow`, so a clean training run lands a model
   ready for shadow consumption (predictions logged, decisions
   unchanged). Promotion past shadow (`shadow → advisory`) still
   requires `python -m ml promote-stage --by <name> --reason <text>`
   and operator approval. Models can be parked back at `candidate`
   via the same CLI when an operator wants them out of the shadow
   channel without retraining. (Stage ladder collapsed 7→3 on
   2026-06-16 — canonical `candidate → shadow → advisory`; legacy
   `research_only`/`backtest_approved → candidate` and
   `limited_live`/`live_approved → advisory` alias via
   `ml.manifest.canonical_stage`.)

Training sessions MUST use these established baselines + manifests
rather than reinventing. Adding a new baseline follows the
"Adding a new family" / "Adding a new trainer" rules in
[`docs/data/dataset-taxonomy.md`](data/dataset-taxonomy.md) and
[`docs/ml/training-center.md`](ml/training-center.md).

**New strategies + the cycle (S9, 2026-05-24).** The recurring
`run_training_cycle.sh` trains every manifest in `ml/configs/` each
cycle. The `trade_outcomes` manifests are roster-agnostic —
`baseline-trade-outcome-global.yaml` is `symbol_scope: all` (all rows,
strategy ignored) and `baseline-trade-outcome-winrate.yaml` groups by
`strategy_name` — so trades from the new members (`trend_donchian`,
`fade_breakout_4h`, and `squeeze_breakout_4h` once merged) **feed the
datasets automatically with no manifest change**. No per-strategy
manifest is scoped to the new strategies yet, and none is required for
ingestion. The one **new training target** is the cross-strategy
**decider-v2 selection model** ("which signal to trust now" — the
models-in-the-loop belongs here, NOT the per-strategy entry filter,
which failed because the trend edge is exit-driven): it is research-
stage and should be added as a manifest only **once ≥2 members are
live** (until then it has insufficient multi-member feedstock). Design:
[`docs/sprint-plans/DECIDER-SINGLE-ACCOUNT-2026-05-24.md`](sprint-plans/DECIDER-SINGLE-ACCOUNT-2026-05-24.md).
The decider remains research-stage (no simulator script wired yet;
research harnesses live under `scripts/research/`).

The full AI-platform architecture (five-layer model, leakage rules,
forbidden behaviors, model registry append-only invariant) lives in
[`docs/architecture/ai-model-platform.md`](architecture/ai-model-platform.md).

### VM topology (CANONICAL — single source of truth; live→Ampere migration COMPLETE 2026-06-14)

> **This table is the single canonical VM topology.** Every other doc,
> skill, runbook, and script should LINK here rather than re-state a VM IP
> or shape. When the topology changes, update THIS table and its mirror in
> `CLAUDE.md` § "VM authority split" — nothing else should hardcode a VM IP.

The "no heavy training on the Oracle live VM" non-negotiable
([`AI-TRADERS-ROADMAP.md`](AI-TRADERS-ROADMAP.md)) is enforced by
**topology**, not just policy. The system spans **three** Ampere VMs in the
same compartment + VCN — the money box is deliberately isolated:

| VM | Shape | Role | Systemd units | Marker file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Live trader** `ict-bot-arm` (`141.145.193.91`) | `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` — **2 OCPU / 12 GB, Ampere aarch64** | Deterministic trade execution; FastAPI dashboard surface (`:8001`) | `ict-trader-live.service`, `ict-web-api.service` | `data-dir-nomount.conf` drop-in (`/data/bot-data` on boot volume) |
| **Training-center** (`158.178.209.121`) | `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` 1 OCPU / 6 GB (Ampere) | Model training, dataset builds, registry writes, experiment runs | `ict-trainer.service` (disabled by default), `ict-trainer.timer` (disabled by default) | `/etc/ict-trainer-vm.role` → `training-center` |
| **IB Gateway** (`ict-ib-gateway`, private IP `10.0.0.251`) | `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` 1 OCPU / 6 GB (Ampere) | Headless IB Gateway (Docker + socat) for MES/IBKR — isolated off the money box | `ict-ib-gateway-reset.{service,timer}` (daily **06:05 UTC** `docker restart`, retimed 2026-07-02 from 05:30 — BL-20260623-002) | `/etc/ict/ib-gateway-docker.env` (gates the reset.service) |

**Ampere Always-Free budget: trainer 1 + gateway 1 + live 2 = 4 of 4 OCPUs
(6 + 6 + 12 = 24 of 24 GB) — the pool is now FULL.** The **live→Ampere
migration COMPLETED 2026-06-14** (`.github/workflows/cutover-live.yml`); the
retired x86 micro `158.178.210.252` (a *separate* AMD Always-Free allocation,
display name `ict-bot`) was **terminated 2026-06-16** and is no longer a
rollback target. The gateway was moved onto its own VM (gateway-isolation,
Plan B) because the heavy Java/Xvfb/IBC gateway sharing the old 1 GB micro
with the trader caused the 2026-06-10 CPU-wedge cascade; the trader now
reaches it across the private subnet
(`config/accounts.yaml::ib_paper.ib_host = 10.0.0.251`). Full topology +
rationale:
[`docs/runbooks/live-vm-migration-ampere.md`](runbooks/live-vm-migration-ampere.md),
[`docs/runbooks/ib-integration.md`](runbooks/ib-integration.md)
§ "Gateway isolation redesign", and `CLAUDE.md` § "VM authority split".

The training-center VM is provisioned via
[`.github/workflows/provision-training-vm.yml`](../.github/workflows/provision-training-vm.yml)
+ [`scripts/ops/provision_training_vm.py`](../scripts/ops/provision_training_vm.py).
Cloud-init bootstraps it from
[`deploy/training-vm-cloud-init.yaml`](../deploy/training-vm-cloud-init.yaml)
with the repo cloned to `/home/ubuntu/ict-trading-bot` and the
trainer systemd unit installed but **disabled** — the operator
opts in to training cycles explicitly, so the Always Free quota
isn't consumed by idle compute.

The **authority split** is documented in
[`docs/claude/trainer-vm-mode.md`](claude/trainer-vm-mode.md): trainer
VM is autonomous-Claude (provision, SSH, install, train, register,
promote up to `advisory`); live VM stays under the restrictive
contract in [`docs/claude/vm-operator-mode.md`](claude/vm-operator-mode.md).

The boundary that prevents trainer autonomy from leaking into live
**decisions** is the **stage** boundary, not the YAML wire-up
(2026-05-19 update). As of the default-flip, any model registered
at `target_deployment_stage: shadow` is auto-wired onto every
strategy's shadow channel — predictions are logged on signals
without operator approval. Operator approval is still required for
the cross into live influence: the
`shadow → advisory` promotion (the single live-influence gate; the
former `limited_live`/`live_approved` tiers collapsed into `advisory`
2026-06-16) remains gated, and the live-trader's order package is
unaffected by shadow predictions per the WS7 non-negotiable. An operator who
wants a strategy *not* to log against the auto-wired set sets
`shadow_model_ids: []` (explicit opt-out) or provides an explicit
non-empty list in `config/strategies.yaml` to pin specific models.

**Cross-VM data flow** (filed for follow-up — not yet wired):
- Live VM owns `trade_journal.db`. The training center needs
  read access for label feedstock. Options: scheduled rsync from
  live VM, or read via the `/api/diag/*` surface over HTTPS. No
  decision yet.
- Training center owns the registry-store + experiment runs.
  Promoted models flow back to the live VM via
  `git pull` + the operator's deploy workflow (existing
  `system-actions.yml::pull-and-deploy`).

**Cross-VM SSH**: both VMs accept the same `VM_SSH_KEY` (operator
chose key-reuse — same private key, simpler rotation). If the
threat model later requires isolated keys, the workflow accepts
a `TRAINER_VM_SSH_KEY` secret override.

## Evidence and Documentation Flow

Every major code change must produce or update at least one of:
- a sprint log (`docs/sprint-logs/<id>.md`),
- the roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`),
- a canonical doc (this doc, the rules doc, the AI-platform doc, or
  `docs/github-actions-workflows.md`),
- subsystem docs under `docs/claude/`, `docs/operator/`, etc.,
- evidence in `tests/`, `experiments/`, or `runtime_logs/`.

Chat memory and PR descriptions are not the system of record.

## Known Architecture Risks (verified 2026-05-10)

The following risks are observed in the current repo and tracked in the
roadmap rather than silently ignored:

- **Stale repo references**: a number of active docs and scripts still
  reference `the-lizardking/ict-trading-bot`. Inventory is maintained
  in the audit section of `docs/sprint-logs/S-CANON-1.md`.
- **Doc proliferation under `docs/claude/`**: 50+ working notes; the
  canonical-doc set above is the new authoritative apex. Older notes
  remain useful but non-authoritative on policy.
- **Sprint summary divergence**: sprint summaries and sprint prompts
  exist in two folders (`docs/sprint-summaries/`, `docs/sprint-plans/`).
  New work uses `docs/sprint-logs/` with the canonical template.
- **No GitHub Actions reference doc** (now resolved by
  [`github-actions-workflows.md`](github-actions-workflows.md)).
- **Empty / spurious sqlite-connection-named files** in the repo root
  (`<sqlite3.Connection object at 0x...>`). Diagnosed in this audit.
- **AI-scope known gaps** — see
  [`architecture/ai-model-platform.md`](architecture/ai-model-platform.md)
  § Known Gaps. The current `ml/` tree is vestigial; WS3–WS10 deliver
  the target dataset / training / registry / monitoring stack.

## Architecture Update Rule

This document must be reviewed whenever a sprint changes:

- runtime flow,
- subsystem boundaries,
- deployment behavior,
- operator communication behavior,
- GitHub Actions automation,
- or any canonical file path used as part of the operating model.

When the change touches any stage of the trade pipeline (any block in
[`TRADE-PIPELINE.md`](TRADE-PIPELINE.md)), that document must be
updated in the same sprint and the dashboard's **Trade Process** tab
visually verified after merge to `main`. The dashboard fetches the
pipeline doc directly from this repo, so a stale doc means a stale
operator UI.

For AI-scope changes (data → feature → model → orchestration →
control layer boundaries, dataset families, model registry, deployment
tiers, Oracle/HF split) the corresponding doc to update is
[`architecture/ai-model-platform.md`](architecture/ai-model-platform.md).

## Verification Checklist (current state)

## Change log

Architecture-impacting changes (per the rubric in
[`architecture/ARCHITECTURE-CHANGE-CHECKLIST.md`](architecture/ARCHITECTURE-CHANGE-CHECKLIST.md))
land a row here. Per-PR ledger sits in
[`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md); the table below is curated and
filtered to architecture-level deltas only.

| Date | Sprint | Change | Files touched | Operator impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-10 | S-CANON-1 | Canonical-doc adoption: this file supersedes the older `docs/architecture.md` and the architecture sections of root `CLAUDE.md`. Companion rules doc + sprint-log template + canonical workflows doc all stand. | `docs/ARCHITECTURE-CANONICAL.md`, `docs/CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md`, `docs/SPRINT-LOG-TEMPLATE-CANONICAL.md`, `docs/github-actions-workflows.md` | None — informational. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS1..WS4 | AI platform baseline: pipeline stage contracts (`docs/pipeline/stage-contracts.md`), typed dataclasses (`src/pipeline/types.py`), dataset framework (`ml/datasets/`), training center + registry + Predictor + splitters + compare (`ml/`). | `ml/`, `src/pipeline/`, `docs/pipeline/`, `docs/architecture/ai-model-platform.md` | None — research-only. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS5-A..F | Six baseline models registered + paired manifests. None promoted past `candidate`. | `ml/configs/*.yaml`, `ml/trainers/`, `ml/datasets/families/`, `ml/registry-store/` | None — research-only. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS7-PART-1 | Model registry gains `target_deployment_stage` + canonical stage ladder (`research_only` → `candidate` → `backtest_approved` → `shadow` → `advisory` → `limited_live` → `live_approved`). Append-only `StatusEvent` history; `promote_stage()` requires `--by` + `--reason`. | `ml/registry/`, `ml/promotion/` | None — registry unread by runtime. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS7-PART-2..6 | Shadow harness complete. `src/runtime/shadow_adapter.py::with_shadow_pred` + `with_shadow_preds` helpers (per-predictor failure isolation). `ml/shadow/factory.py` resolves `shadow_model_ids` against the registry with a stage gate (`{shadow, advisory, limited_live, live_approved}` allowed; `{research_only, candidate, backtest_approved}` refused). Both production strategies (`vwap` + `turtle_soup`) wired. `Coordinator._shadow_predictors_cache` lifts the factory call to O(reloads). | `src/runtime/shadow_adapter.py`, `ml/shadow/*`, `src/units/strategies/vwap.py`, `src/units/strategies/turtle_soup.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, `config/strategies.yaml` | None unless operator sets a non-empty `shadow_model_ids`. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS8-PART-1 | Shadow-predictions audit log gains an operator surface: `ml/shadow/inspector.py` (streaming reader + filters + per-(model_id, stage) aggregate + text formatters) + `python -m ml shadow-inspect`/`shadow-stats` CLI subcommands. | `ml/shadow/inspector.py`, `ml/cli.py` | None — diagnostic tooling, read-only. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS8-PART-2 | Public API surface: `/api/bot/shadow/{predictions,stats}` Tier-1 endpoints over `runtime_logs/shadow_predictions.jsonl`. Envelope `{log_present, log_path, records[], count}` distinguishes "no records yet" from "log missing". Same `ml.shadow.inspector` backing as the CLI — zero duplicate parsing. | `src/web/api/routers/shadow.py`, `src/web/api/main.py`, CLAUDE.md | None — read-only, additive. Dashboard consumes once UI lands. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS8-PART-3 | Drift detector: `ml/shadow/drift.py` (KS statistic + PSI score + window-over-window summary stats). New `GET /api/bot/shadow/drift?model_id=X` endpoint with reference / current window parameters. New `python -m ml shadow-drift` CLI subcommand. | `ml/shadow/drift.py`, `src/web/api/routers/shadow.py`, `ml/cli.py` | None — read-only, additive. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS7-FU | Shadow audit-log rotation: `scripts/ops/rotate_shadow_log.py` + `deploy/ict-shadow-log-rotate.{service,timer}` (disabled by default). Size-OR-age thresholds (default 100 MiB / 7 days) with atomic rename + same-day collision handling. | `scripts/ops/rotate_shadow_log.py`, `deploy/ict-shadow-log-rotate.*`, `tests/test_rotate_shadow_log.py` | Operator enables timer when shadow mode activates. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS9 | Two-VM topology: training-center VM provisioning via OCI Always Free Ampere A1. New `scripts/ops/provision_training_vm.py`, `.github/workflows/provision-training-vm.yml` (dispatch + issue-trigger), `deploy/training-vm-cloud-init.yaml`, operator runbook. Makes "no heavy training on the live VM" enforced by topology, not just policy. New VM bootstraps with `ict-trainer.service` DISABLED — operator opts in. | `scripts/ops/provision_training_vm.py`, `.github/workflows/provision-training-vm.yml`, `deploy/training-vm-cloud-init.yaml`, `docs/runbooks/training-vm.md`, this file | Operator triggers workflow once to spin up the trainer VM; no impact on live trader. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS9-FU | `scripts/ops/run_training_cycle.sh` lands — the body of `ict-trainer.service`. Pulls main, manages venv, iterates `ml/configs/` manifests, emits JSONL events. Stops at `research_only` (the per-PR follow-up `train_and_register_ws5_baselines.sh` walks the ladder). | `scripts/ops/run_training_cycle.sh`, `tests/test_run_training_cycle_sh.py` | Operator can now enable `ict-trainer.service` without the unit failing on missing ExecStart. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS10 | Architecture-doc enforcement scaffold. New `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE-CHANGE-CHECKLIST.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with arch-impact checkboxes, advisory `.github/workflows/arch-doc-guard.yml` (soft `::warning`, never fails). | `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE-CHANGE-CHECKLIST.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/workflows/arch-doc-guard.yml`, `scripts/arch_doc_guard.py`, this file | None — informational. |
| 2026-05-10 | S-AI-WS10-FU | WS10 follow-ups: opt-in pre-commit hook `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` wrapping the same `arch_doc_guard.py`, weekly `.github/workflows/doc-audit-weekly.yml` that audits the Verification Checklist for broken paths. Both shipped with their own tests. | `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, `scripts/install-hooks.sh`, `.github/workflows/doc-audit-weekly.yml`, `scripts/ops/audit_verification_checklist.py` | None — informational. |
| 2026-05-11 | S-AUTH-SPLIT | Two-VM trust-contract split adopted. New `docs/claude/trainer-vm-mode.md` (autonomous-Claude charter — provision / SSH / train / register / promote without operator-in-the-loop, bounded by hard limits on cross-VM and live-config writes). `docs/claude/vm-operator-mode.md` scoped explicitly to the live VM. Operator-approval gate on model promotions clarified: applies only at the live-VM `shadow_model_ids` YAML wiring, not at registry stage promotion. | `docs/claude/trainer-vm-mode.md` (NEW), `docs/claude/vm-operator-mode.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/AI-TRADERS-ROADMAP.md`, `docs/runbooks/training-vm.md`, `.github/workflows/provision-training-vm.yml` | None on live VM behaviour. Claude can now operate the trainer end-to-end. |
| 2026-05-11 | S-AI-WS9-AUTORETRY | Inter-process contract: new `.github/workflows/provision-training-vm-auto-retry.yml` fires every 10 min, checks via OCI whether `ict-trainer-vm` exists, dispatches the provision workflow if not. On first detection of `exists=true`, files a one-shot `[trainer-vm-up]` GitHub issue so the operator gets a notification via repo subscription. Bypasses the "OCI Always Free A1 capacity is intermittent" wall without operator polling. | `.github/workflows/provision-training-vm-auto-retry.yml` (NEW) | None — autonomous retry until the trainer VM lands. |
| 2026-05-11 | S-AI-WS5-BOOTSTRAP | New `scripts/ops/train_and_register_ws5_baselines.sh` — the trainer's "first action" once the VM is up. Trains every `baseline-*.yaml`, walks each new model id up the promotion ladder to `TARGET_STAGE` (default `shadow`, the minimum the WS7 factory will load). Emits JSONL to `runtime_logs/trainer/ws5_baseline_kickoff.jsonl`. Distinct from the recurring `run_training_cycle.sh`. | `scripts/ops/train_and_register_ws5_baselines.sh`, `tests/test_train_and_register_ws5_baselines_sh.py`, `docs/runbooks/training-vm.md` | None until the trainer VM is up + the operator runs the script there. |
| 2026-05-11 | S-AI-WS10-CLOSEOUT | WS10 explicitly closed. Change log refreshed to reflect today's S-AUTH-SPLIT, S-AI-WS9-AUTORETRY, S-AI-WS5-BOOTSTRAP plus the previously-missing S-AI-WS8-PART-2/3, S-AI-WS7-FU, S-AI-WS9-FU, S-AI-WS10-FU rows. Known Gaps section pruned (resolved entries removed; new gaps added) so the section reflects today's queue. Roadmap WS10 row marked DONE. | `docs/ARCHITECTURE-CANONICAL.md`, `docs/AI-TRADERS-ROADMAP.md`, `docs/sprint-plans/ai-traders/ws10-arch-doc-enforcement.md` | None — the close-out is itself the verification that WS10 prevents drift. |
| 2026-05-12 | (post-S-CANON) | **Mode Mutation Contract enshrined** (§ above). `set-account-mode` operator action (PR #978) becomes the only path to mutate `config/accounts.yaml` `mode:`. Prime Directive added to CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md. Follow-on safeguards PR queued to remove the remaining auto-flip vectors: `_DRY_RUN_OVERRIDES` + `set_account_dry_run()` in `src/units/accounts/__init__.py`, the breaker auto-flip in `src/core/coordinator.py:1048-1068`, and the Telegram `/accounts dry\|live` handler (refactored to dispatch `set-account-mode`). | `docs/CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE-CANONICAL.md`, `docs/claude/trading-mode-flags.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/workflows/system-actions.yml` (PR #978), `scripts/ops/set_account_mode.sh` (PR #978), `docs/claude/system-actions.md` (PR #978) | The trader stays live by design. Operator dispatches `set-account-mode` to flip mode; per-trade Telegram on every RiskManager rejection arrives in the safeguards PR. |
| 2026-05-19 | (shadow-default-flip) | **Shadow becomes the default deployment stage; auto-wire replaces per-strategy `shadow_model_ids` lists.** `_DEFAULT_STAGE` flipped from `research_only` → `shadow` in `ml/registry/model_registry.py`; all 9 baseline manifests (`ml/configs/baseline-*.yaml`) updated to declare `target_deployment_stage: shadow`; direct one-hop edges added in `_STAGE_TRANSITIONS` (`research_only`/`candidate` → `shadow` plus rollbacks). `ml.shadow.factory.discover_shadow_stage_model_ids()` returns every shadow-stage model id; `Coordinator._get_shadow_predictors` falls back to that discovery when a strategy has no `shadow_model_ids` (or explicit `None`). Strategies opt out with `shadow_model_ids: []` or pin with a non-empty list. New `python -m ml promote-stage` CLI subcommand (with `--all-pre-shadow` bulk helper) for legacy-registry migration. `turtle_soup` and `ict_scalp_5m` flipped to the auto-wire default in `config/strategies.yaml`. The boundary that prevents trainer-VM autonomy from leaking into live decisions moves from the YAML wire-up to the `shadow → advisory` promotion gate; the latter still requires operator approval. | `ml/registry/model_registry.py`, `ml/configs/baseline-*.yaml`, `ml/cli.py`, `ml/shadow/factory.py`, `ml/shadow/__init__.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, `config/strategies.yaml`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE-CANONICAL.md`, `scripts/ops/train_and_register_ws5_baselines.sh`, `scripts/ops/run_training_cycle.sh`, plus matching tests. | Live-VM impact: once the trainer-VM registry-store is migrated (separate diag relay) and the live VM next reloads strategy config, every shadow-stage model starts logging predictions on every strategy's signals to `runtime_logs/shadow_predictions.jsonl`. Order package is unaffected (WS7 non-negotiable). |
| 2026-05-19 | (post-flip rollout — PRs #1521 / #1529 / #1530 / #1538 / #1548) | **Five follow-on PRs that landed in the same session, post-shadow-default flip.** PR #1521: `ShadowPredictor` now writes the full signal-time `feature_row` (`strategy_name`, `symbol`, `direction`, `confidence`, `setup_type`, `killzone`, `bias`) alongside the existing `row_keys`; `/api/bot/trades/scores` join filters by `feature_row.symbol == trade.symbol` so concurrent BTC/ETH trades no longer cross-pollinate. PR #1529: `_close_trade_from_order_status` backfills `trade.entry_price` from Bybit's `avg_price` (closes the `execution-quality-baseline-v0` mae=0.0 degeneracy by giving the dataset real signed slippage); `scripts/ops/sync_trainer_data.sh::LIVE_VM_AUDIT_PATH` default updated to `/data/bot-data/runtime_logs/signal_audit.jsonl` (the canonical post-2026-05-12 DATA_DIR path) so `setup_labels_audit` stops freezing. PR #1530: `baseline-backtest-mean.yaml` + `baseline-post-trade-review.yaml` renamed to `.yaml.disabled` until their feedstock pipelines (Telegram `/test` runs + `/health-review` skill output) accumulate enough rows to train on. PR #1538: new `python -m ml backfill-shadow-predictions` CLI replays every historical trade (1,565 on the trainer's synced DB) through every shadow-stage model and writes the results to `runtime_logs/shadow_predictions_backfill.jsonl`; records carry `backfill_kind: "retroactive_decision"` + `trade_id` so `/api/bot/trades/scores` joins them by `trade_id` (deterministic, regardless of timestamp), and the existing real-time symbol+timestamp-window fallback handles non-backfill records. The endpoint envelope gains `backfill_log_present`, `backfill_log_path`, and a per-score `backfill_kind` field. PR #1548: `Coordinator._get_shadow_predictors` resolves the default audit log path through `runtime_logs_dir()` so the trader writes to the same canonical location `trade_scores.py` reads from (closing the writer-vs-reader split where the live trader wrote to `/home/ubuntu/ict-trading-bot/runtime_logs/` while the endpoint read from `/data/bot-data/runtime_logs/`). | `ml/predictors/shadow.py`, `ml/shadow/inspector.py`, `ml/shadow/backfill.py` (NEW), `ml/cli.py`, `src/web/api/routers/trade_scores.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, `src/runtime/order_monitor.py`, `scripts/ops/sync_trainer_data.sh`, `ml/configs/baseline-{backtest-mean,post-trade-review}.yaml.disabled`, `CLAUDE.md` (`/api/bot/trades/scores` shape), plus matching tests. | Live-VM impact: the dashboard's `/api/bot/trades/scores` now serves 10,955 retroactive scores (7 shadow models × 1,565 trades) joined deterministically to every historical trade in the trainer-synced DB; future closed trades get the real Bybit fill price recorded; future signals write shadow predictions at the canonical path so they show alongside the backfill. Order package still unaffected. |
| 2026-05-22 | S-MES-GOLIVE | **MES paper trading went LIVE — the bot now trades two symbols (BTCUSDT + MES) every tick.** Market-data intake is multi-source: `connector_for_symbol()` routes MES to `src/exchange/ib_connector.py::IBMarketData` (delayed CME bars via `reqHistoricalData(3)`, no paid real-time sub) and BTCUSDT to Bybit. All three strategies are symbol-parameterized and evaluate both symbols; a symbol→exchange dispatch gate in `coordinator.py` keeps signals on the right account. Execution: `execute._submit_order` `interactive_brokers` branch → `IBClient.place` (native MES bracket, no API keys — auth is the Gateway login session). The IB Gateway runs headless as the gnzsnz Docker image with a **socat relay** (host `127.0.0.1:4002` → container `4004` → gateway `4002`); the paper account logs in with **no 2FA**. Two fixes made it work end-to-end: #1706 mapped the host port to the socat relay (4004) instead of the gateway's localhost-only 4002 (was `TimeoutError`), and #1712 gave `IBClient` a persistent asyncio loop re-asserted on every `connect()` (Telegram alerts' `asyncio.run` nulls the thread loop, which had broken `reqHistoricalData` with "no current event loop"). `ib_paper.ib_port` 7497→4002; `ib_paper.strategies` now lists all three. `ib_live` (real money) stays `mode: dry_run`. | `src/units/accounts/ib_client.py`, `src/exchange/ib_connector.py`, `config/accounts.yaml`, `scripts/install_ib_gateway_docker.sh`, `docs/runbooks/ib-integration.md`, `docs/architecture/multi-strategy-architecture-target.md`, this file, `tests/test_ib_integration.py` | Live VM: MES paper orders now execute against IB paper money alongside live BTCUSDT; real-money `ib_live` untouched (dry_run). Gateway re-provision (`provision-ib-gateway`) is autonomous for paper (no 2FA); IB Python-path changes need only `pull-and-deploy`. |
| 2026-05-21 | (shadow-live-wiring + CI-hardening + triage) | **Shadow predictions made real on the live path; CI turned into a genuine merge gate; ~94 stale tests fixed + real bugs surfaced.** (1) **Shadow auto-wire fix** (#1630): the live multiplexed pipeline runs strategies through `src/runtime/strategy_signal_builders.py`, not `Coordinator.order_package()`, so the 2026-05-19 auto-wire never fired — zero shadow predictions despite 7 shadow-stage models. Added a generic `_resolve_shadow_predictors`/`_emit_shadow_preds` (mirrors `Coordinator._get_shadow_predictors` tri-state) wired into all three builders; made `/api/bot/ml/registry`'s `deployment_bucket` auto-wire-aware so shadow-stage models render SHADOW not OFFLINE. Verified live: all 7 models now log on every actionable signal. (2) **Diag/admin observability relays**: `/api/diag/log_file` allowlist gained `shadow_predictions` + `_backfill` (#1634); new `branch-protection-report.yml` (read GitHub admin state) and `delete-merged-branches.yml` (runner-side branch cleanup — the sandbox proxy blocks `git push --delete`). (3) **`backfill-shadow-predictions` operator action** (#1635/#1639) — replays all history through shadow models onto the live VM. (4) **CI now executes tests**: new `pytest-run.yml` (advisory) runs the full suite (`pytest-collect` only imported); `branch-protection-sync` set to `enforce_admins: true` + promoted `env-gate-guard`/`silent-empty-guard`/`canonical-config-loaders`/`canonical-db-resolver` to required (8 total) — admin/API merges no longer bypass checks. (5) **Test-backlog triage** (#1648/#1649/#1650/#1651): ~94 stale-test fixes across telegram/web-api/order-monitor/accounts; fixed a real bug (`run_monitor_tick` returned `None` despite its dict contract). (6) **Real bugs flagged + fixed**: removed dead `/ui/fragments/{status,pnl}` routers that 500'd in prod (#1654); corrected Bybit V5 spot order semantics in `execute.py` (#1655, dormant path — all live accounts are linear). (7) Deleted 757 merged-PR branches.

| 2026-05-22 | (pytest-run promotion) | **`pytest-run` promoted from advisory to a required status check (9 required contexts total).** The full-suite gate (added 2026-05-21, advisory) had its baseline driven green, then `"pytest-run"` was added to `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` in `branch-protection-sync.yml` (#1721). Path to green: #1658-1667 cleared the original failure backlog; #1681 fixed order-dependent test-isolation failures + post-IB-merge contract drift (`ib-gateway.service` in `EXPECTED_SERVICES`; the `enable-mes`/`disable-mes`/`gateway-logs` system-action allowlist + wrapper/notify/doc contracts); #1717 fixed the last CI-only failure — `test_deploy_pull_restart_enumeration`'s `sudo` stub (`exit 0`) assumed root uid, so it passed on root dev containers but failed on GitHub's non-root runner, diagnosed via a temporary `pytest-diag` workflow run on the real runner. Closes the gap `pytest-collect` left open (imports only, never executed an assertion). | `.github/workflows/{pytest-run,branch-protection-sync}.yml`, `docs/claude/ci-status-checks.md`, `docs/github-actions-workflows.md`, this file, several `tests/` | None on live-VM behaviour — CI-gating only. Future PRs must keep the full suite green to merge. |
| 2026-05-23 | S-PERSIST-CANON | **Persistence centralized into one federated canonical store + daily_risk_state fixed.** (1) Single canonical Python DB-path resolver `src.utils.paths.trade_journal_db_path()` (env → $DATA_DIR → repo-root, never CWD-relative); ~20 inline `os.environ.get("TRADE_JOURNAL_DB") or "trade_journal.db"` idioms consolidated onto it; `Database()` defaults to it; `canonical-db-resolver` guard extended to forbid the CWD-relative fallback + inline env-reads in Python (not just shell). This eliminates the root cause of the stray duplicate journals. (2) New federated sidecar `trainer_store.db` (`src/units/db/trainer_store.py`) ingests the trainer-mirror JSONL/JSON (training_cycle, dataset_builds, db_pulls, model_registry, experiment_runs, backtest_sweeps); the Data Explorer federates both DBs. (3) `daily_risk_state` self-healing rebuild in `RiskManager` (was empty because record_trade_result/update_equity had no runtime callers) — makes the per-account daily-loss / max-drawdown caps persist across restarts AND actually enforce. (4) `strategy_versions` (was dead) wired to a boot-time content-hashed snapshot of `config/strategies.yaml`.

| 2026-05-23/24 | S-STRAT-IMPROVE-S8/S9 | **Multi-member book + per-strategy execution gate + single-account decider.** (1) **Per-strategy `execution: live \| shadow` gate** (S9, operator-approved 2026-05-24): a second declared, default-permissive execution gate beside accounts.yaml `mode:`. `shadow` runs + LOGS order packages everywhere (data collection) but never sends a live order — enforced in `Coordinator.multi_account_execute` by folding into the same `effective_dry` resolution as `mode:` (no new order path); fails OPEN on a registry-read error (treats as dry). Read from the registry via `src/strategy_registry.py::execution_mode`; surfaced on `/api/bot/config`. Codified in CLAUDE.md + CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL.md Prime Directive. (2) **Roster grew 3 → 5** (squeeze = pending 6th): `trend_donchian` (Donchian-breakout trend-follower) went live on bybit_2 (real money) at 1h (S8) then **migrated 1h → 2h** (S9, +52.5R/6yr, net-positive every year, walk-forward validated); `fade_breakout_4h` (failed-breakout fade, uncorrelated complement, monthly_corr 0.035) wired `execution: shadow` → bybit_1 (demo); `squeeze_breakout_4h` (volatility-squeeze breakout, corr 0.30) built `shadow`, PRs #1907/#1908 pending operator merge. (3) **Single-account decider design** (operator direction 2026-05-24): one pot of capital used maximally, all strategies running, a decider concentrating the fund on the best opportunity each tick — NOT a per-strategy capital split. Supersedes the multi-account-blend design (PR #1902, closed). The intent aggregator IS the decider (crude static-priority today); decider-v2 makes it smart once ≥2 members live. (4) **MES / cross-asset data** sourced + cached: clean 1m S&P 500 via Dukascopy (`data/SPX500_1m.parquet`, 2020–2026, on the trainer), SPX-trend net-positive + near-uncorrelated with BTC (corr 0.009). | `config/strategies.yaml`, `config/accounts.yaml`, `src/strategy_registry.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, `src/units/strategies/{trend_donchian,fade_breakout_4h,squeeze_breakout_4h}.py`, `src/runtime/{strategy_signal_builders,pipeline,intent_multiplexer,intents}.py`, `scripts/{backtest_trend,backtest_fade,backtest_squeeze,research_decider}.py`, `scripts/ops/fetch_dukascopy_index.py`, `docs/sprint-plans/DECIDER-SINGLE-ACCOUNT-2026-05-24.md`, `docs/sprint-logs/S-STRAT-IMPROVE-S9-2026-05-24.md`, `docs/audits/{fade,squeeze}-breakout-complement-2026-05-24.md`, README, `.claude/skills/{new-strategy,health-review}/SKILL.md`, this file | Live VM: `trend_donchian` trades real money on bybit_2 (2h); `vwap` + `fade_breakout_4h` are `execution: shadow` (data-only, no money). bybit_1 (demo) mirrors the full roster for shadow data. Squeeze begins shadow on operator merge of #1907/#1908. MES execution waits on IBKR new-user approval (data + edge already validated). |
| 2026-05-22 | (regime-shadow-wiring + MES-mirror + promotion-tracker) | **Regime shadow models made informative; MES mirror activated config-driven (second gate removed); promotion tracker shipped.** (1) **Regime feature wiring** (#1722): the four regime classifiers (`{btc,mes}-regime-{5m,15m}`) were live-shadowing but emitting a *constant* score — the strategy feature row carried no `vol_bucket`, so each predictor fell back to its training marginal. `RegimeClassifierTrainer` now freezes the quantile bucket edges + vol window + symbol/timeframe into `model_state`; new `src/runtime/regime_shadow.py` computes the live `vol_bucket` per tick from candles and feeds it only to the matching `(symbol, timeframe)` model; the strategy-monocle open-package gates were scoped by symbol. All four models retrained with edges; verified live (`btc-regime-5m` now scores 0.835 on `vol_b2`, not the old 0.7164 constant). Stale 1d v0 regime models demoted to `research_only`. (2) **MES mirror** (#1761): all three strategies now trade BTCUSDT + MES every tick. Tick symbols are derived from `config/accounts.yaml` (`_resolve_tick_symbols` unions every configured account's `symbols`); **`MULTI_SYMBOL_ENABLED` removed** — it was a forbidden second gate that left `ib_paper` (`mode: live`, all three strategies) idle. `mode:` is now the only runtime gate; the `enable-mes`/`disable-mes` operator actions + wrappers were deleted, and "no second gate; nothing defaults to off" was codified as Prime Directive rule 6. Verified live: every tick logs both symbols × three strategies, MES data flows from the IB paper gateway, per-symbol isolation holds (BTC's open vwap package no longer suppresses MES). (3) **Promotion-readiness tracker** (ict-trader-dashboard #62): new 🚦 Promotion page grades each shadow model (prediction volume, days-in-shadow, score range, wired check, KS/PSI drift, win/loss score edge) toward the operator-gated shadow→advisory promotion. | `ml/trainers/regime_classifier.py`, `ml/predictors/{per_bucket_multiclass,shadow}.py`, `src/runtime/{regime_shadow,strategy_signal_builders,intents,pipeline,strategy_monocle}.py`, `src/units/db/database.py`, `src/units/accounts/{account,__init__}.py`, `src/main.py`, `config/{accounts,strategies}.yaml`, `ml/configs/*regime*.yaml`, `.github/workflows/system-actions.yml`, `docs/{CLAUDE-RULES-CANONICAL,claude/system-actions,runbooks/ib-integration}.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, ict-trader-dashboard `streamlit_app.py`, many `tests/` | Live VM: regime shadow predictions now carry a real `vol_bucket` (still observe-only — never touches orders); MES paper trades as a full mirror of BTC across all three strategies; the only runtime gate is each account's `mode:`. |
| 2026-05-25 | (strategy-promotion + watchdog-fix) | **fade/squeeze promoted shadow→live + symmetric bybit roster + timeframe-aware stuck-watchdog.** (1) **Roster fully live** (PR #1995, operator-approved Tier-3): `fade_breakout_4h` + `squeeze_breakout_4h` flipped `execution: shadow`→`live`; both `bybit_1` (demo) and `bybit_2` (real money) now carry the **identical** six-strategy list `[trend_donchian, turtle_soup, ict_scalp_5m, fade_breakout_4h, squeeze_breakout_4h, vwap]` — everything live except `vwap` (stays `execution: shadow`, data-only). Supersedes the 2026-05-23/24 row's "fade/squeeze shadow on demo only" state. fade/squeeze are unvalidated-live (OOS expectancy ~half of train) — accepted operator risk; verify-they-trade-correctly logged as backlog BL-20260525-008. (2) **Timeframe-aware stuck-strategy watchdog** (PR #2002): a package's `updated_at` only advances on a non-None monitor verdict (a Chandelier-trail ratchet), so on a multi-hour strategy a healthy position routinely exceeded the flat 30-min threshold and false-fired the position-alive "still stuck" alert. The position-alive quiet window now scales by the package's own bar interval — `max(floor, mult × timeframe)`, floor `STUCK_STRATEGY_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` (30), mult `STUCK_STRATEGY_TIMEFRAME_MULT` (3); genuine orphans (position flat) still force-clear at the floor. Ghost zero-sized reinforcement packages (the deeper cause) logged as BL-20260525-009. (3) **Docs**: corrected the absolute "never merge" Tier-3 rule in CLAUDE.md + deploy/dropins/README.md to "without explicit operator approval" (matches the canonical tier gate); documented the trend_donchian 50R sentinel TP as expected (BL-20260525-007). | `config/accounts.yaml`, `config/strategies.yaml`, `src/runtime/order_monitor.py`, `tests/test_monitor_reconciler.py`, `CLAUDE.md`, `deploy/dropins/README.md`, `docs/claude/health-review-backlog.json`, this file | Live VM (deployed 2026-05-25): bybit_2 executes `fade`/`squeeze` on real money when their setups fire; both bybit accounts run the same roster; the watchdog no longer false-alerts on healthy 2h/4h positions. No `mode:` flips; `vwap` still data-only. |
| 2026-05-31 | (flip-policy default flip) | **Live execution invariant changed: opposite-side conflict in `compute_execution_delta` now noops by default ("hold") instead of close-and-reopening ("reverse").** Walk-forward verified PASS on both pre-agreed criteria across 24 cells (2 anchored folds × 2 halves × 2 rosters × 3 policies) — `docs/audits/walkforward-flip-policy-2026-05-30.md`. 4-member: `hold` beats `reverse` on net AND maxDD% across all four cells, with OOS lift > train lift on both folds. 6-member: `hold` halves the bleed vs `reverse` OOS in both folds (+$5,171 / +$5,329) — but the 6-member book still bleeds because turtle_soup + ict_scalp_5m lose in-system regardless of conflict policy; decider-v2 selection layer remains the prerequisite for those two members' shadow→live promotion. The policy knob itself (`flip_policy` kwarg + `FLIP_POLICY` env-var resolver + tri-state `{reverse, hold, flat}`) was shipped earlier the same day by the operator-led Cross Zero PR #2441; this row covers the operator-approved default flip in PR #2451 (single-line change at `_DEFAULT_FLIP_POLICY`). Aggregator (`aggregate_intents`) is unchanged — it still produces the same `DesiredPosition` with the same `dropped_intents` audit trail; the hold lives downstream at `compute_execution_delta`, the per-account meet-point of aggregator output + current position, exactly where the walk-forward harness modeled it. Coordinator logs every hold as `intent_noop:flip_suppressed_hold_policy:…` in the trade journal (Prime Directive's "no silent state" rule).

Root cause: the only journal-side link was `order_packages.linked_trade_id` (one slot), and every leg of `execute_pkg`'s fanout called `update_order_package(linked_trade_id=<its own row id>)` so only the last writer survived.

Fixes shipped + deployed: (1) **PR #2814** — bound every IB market-data fetch with `IB_FETCH_TIMEOUT_S` (default 8s) so a hung gateway can't stall the tick; added a `sync-clock` system-action for the VM clock skew.

Fix: validation goes through `supported_symbols()` = static base ∪ every symbol declared on an account in accounts.yaml (60s cache; fail-safe to the static base on config-load error — never narrower than before; a typo'd symbol is still rejected because no account declares it). Companion Tier-1 change: per-account `symbols` joins `_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_FIELDS` on `/api/bot/config`, giving consumers the canonical dynamic symbol enumeration — the Streamlit dashboard (ict-trader-dashboard#89) and Android app (ict-trader-android#46) drop their hardcoded chart-symbol lists and derive selectors from the API in the same session. | `src/runtime/intents.py` (`supported_symbols()`), `src/web/api/routers/bot_config.py`, `tests/test_supported_symbols_config_driven.py`, `tests/test_web_api_bot_config.py`, `CLAUDE.md` (API-table row), this file | PR #3358 (Tier-2, order-path adjacent — draft pending operator OK).

Change: (1) `shadow_adapter.capture_shadow_preds()` — score-returning sibling of `with_shadow_preds` (same observe-only contract: one `predict` per model, per-model try/except, **WS7 audit log unchanged**) that RETURNS `{model_id:{stage,score}}`. (2) `strategy_signal_builders._emit_shadow_preds` (the central per-signal scorer for all strategies) captures the scores onto `sig["meta"]["model_scores"]`, which flows signal → intent (`intents.py` copies `dict(signal.meta)`) → `OrderPackage.meta`. (3) New additive `order_packages.model_scores TEXT` column (idempotent `_migrate_add_order_package_model_scores`, mirrors the `_migrate_add_*` pattern); `_log_new_order_package` writes it (kept out of the `meta` blob to avoid duplication). (4) `/api/bot/order-packages` projects it as `modelScores`. **WS7 non-negotiable preserved: the persisted scores are observe-only METADATA on the journal row — the order DECISION / risk path is still byte-identical and never reads them back** (capturing for persistence is fine; acting on them is not).

Each aliased strategy's builder is tagged with its base unit module (a `monitor_unit` attribute, co-located with the builders in `strategy_signal_builders` — the source of truth for which unit they reuse); `pipeline.monitor_unit_for()` derives the mapping from the builder registry (no duplicated map), and `order_monitor._call_strategy_monitor` resolves through it (plain strategies are their own module). Drift guard `tests/test_strategy_monitor_unit_resolution.py` fails CI if a future aliased strategy lacks a resolvable `monitor()`. (2) **Orphan re-attach.** `_adopt_orphan_position` now first recovers the order package that opened the orphan (`_recover_orphan_order_package`: confident symbol + normalised-direction + entry-within-2% match against `get_recent_order_packages_for_symbol`), attributes the adopted trade row to that **originating strategy** carrying the package's stored SL/TP, and **reopens + re-links** the package (`status='open'`, `linked_trade_id`) so the next `run_monitor_tick` runs that strategy's `monitor()` on it. Falls back to the bare `orphan_adopt` row (NULL SL/TP, no fabricated attribution) only when no confident match exists. **No env gate** — re-attach + monitoring are baseline correctness, always on under `ORPHAN_POSITION_POLICY=adopt`; never default-off (Prime Directive). | `src/runtime/pipeline.py` (`monitor_unit_for`), `src/runtime/strategy_signal_builders.py` (per-builder `monitor_unit` tags), `src/runtime/order_monitor.py` (`_call_strategy_monitor`, `_adopt_orphan_position`, `_recover_orphan_order_package`, `_canon_dir`), `src/units/db/database.py` (`get_recent_order_packages_for_symbol`), `tests/test_{orphan_reattach,strategy_monitor_unit_resolution}.py`, this file | PR #3543 (Tier-3 — changes live exit behaviour across the aliased sleeve + adopted orphans).

The API additively emits `accountClass` on `/positions`, `/trades/closed`, `/order-packages` (alongside legacy `isDemo`) + exposes it on `/config`; the real-money aggregates (`/stats`, `/pnl/history`, `/performance`) use an `account_class`-aware "not paper" predicate (falls back to `is_demo` for un-backfilled rows); the include-flag is now `include_paper` (`include_demo` = deprecated alias); `/performance` gains a `paper` sub-block (back-compat `demo` alias). One-shot `scripts/ops/backfill_account_class.py` (dry-run default, `--apply` to write) backfills + corrects existing rows. (2) **Velotrade purge**: deleted `dxtrade_client.py`, `velotrade_client_for`, the executor + coordinator + integrator velotrade branches/`EXCHANGE_MAP` entry, the `prop_velotrade_1` accounts.yaml block + `account_state.yaml` + master-template entries, and `tests/test_velotrade_infrastructure.py`.

| 2026-06-15 | (exit-coverage rebuild — every open trade always has a live exit) | **The invariant that every open trade is, at all times, governed by a live strategy `monitor()` and/or a broker-side backstop — and that the system continuously detects + self-heals any trade out of coverage — is now structurally enforced, with no feature flags in front of it (`BL-20260615-MGCNAKED`; full design `docs/exit-coverage-architecture.md`).** (1) **Sleeve monitor() resolution** (#3662): `pipeline.monitor_unit_for` falls back to the intent-layer roster so the IBKR/FX symbol sleeves (`mgc_trend_1h`, `xauusd_trend_1h`, `spy/qqq/gld/eth_*`) resolve to their engine module's `monitor()` instead of failing to import a same-name module — the root cause of an unmanaged MGC `orphan_adopt`. (2) **Unconditional backstop** (#3674): the naked-position SL/TP re-arm (`_check_naked_positions` → `_attempt_naked_autoprotect` → `IBClient.place_protective`) is baseline — the `NAKED_POSITION_AUTOPROTECT` toggle was removed. (3) **De-gate** (#3676 Phase 1): the `MONITOR_RECONCILE_ENABLED` env gate was REMOVED entirely — the monitor reconciler / self-heal (orphan detect → adopt → reattach → stuck-watchdog → sweeps) runs unconditionally every tick like the core `monitor()` loop. (4) **Reattach-or-close** (#3676 Phase 2): an `orphan_adopt` row with no live monitor first tries to reattach to a recoverable order package; if none exists it is CLOSED (flattened, reusing the reduce-only close path, 2-observation-confirmed, position-aware so a gone position isn't double-handled) — a trade with no rational exit strategy is exited, not rested on a static stop (`_close_unattributable_orphan`). **This SUPERSEDES the earlier "unrecoverable orphan left to keep surfacing" behaviour described in the 2026-06-14 orphan_adopt self-heal row above.** (5) **Monitor-blindness** (#3703 Phase 3): `_call_strategy_monitor` returns `(verdict, status)`; a position whose `monitor()` persistently can't run (module-missing / raised / candles-`None`) fires a one-shot alert (`MONITOR_BLINDNESS_ALERT_TICKS`, default 3) instead of degrading silently. | `src/runtime/order_monitor.py`, `src/runtime/pipeline.py`, `src/runtime/execution_diagnostics.py`, `scripts/render_env_from_master.py`, `docs/exit-coverage-architecture.md` (NEW), `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/runbooks/monitor-reconciler.md`, `docs/claude/trading-mode-flags.md`, this file, + tests | PRs #3662 / #3674 / #3676 / #3703 (Tier-3 — live order/monitor path; operator-approved).

Triggered by `ib_paper` MGC/MHG trades showing `$0.00`; the fix was scoped (operator direction) to the whole-repo structural gap, not the symptom.** Each axis becomes a **declared per-integration capability** (mirroring the 2026-06-15 exit-coverage "baseline, no flag" stance — no kill-switches). (1) **PnL resolution** (#3761): `src/runtime/local_pnl.py` + `order_monitor._sweep_local_pnl_for_unpriced` — *prefer broker truth, else local compute* (`(exit−entry)×qty×contract_value_usd`, mark-to-market exit when no broker fill). Source is declared via `clients.BROKER_PNL_READER_EXCHANGES` (`{bybit}`), default-local; dashboard `_local_unrealised_for_trade` does the same for open positions (`unrealizedPnlSource="markprice_local"`); `coordinator.py` always stamps `order_package_id`. Verified live: orphaned MGC #2596 → +$2600. (2) **Strategy verdict contract** (#3785): `src/runtime/strategy_verdict.py` schema + validator + the `new-strategy` skill step. (3) **Management capability layer** (#3787): `clients.EXCHANGE_MANAGEMENT_CAPS` + `account_supports_management`; the monitor senders return honest `unsupported_op:<op>` instead of `no_client`; Bybit byte-unchanged. (4) **IB + Alpaca close wiring** (#3792): `IBClient.close` (cancel-bracket + opposing reduce sized to the live position) + Alpaca native flatten, routed via `execute.close_open_position` + `_build_account_client`; a strategy's exit verdict now reaches IB/Alpaca. (5) **Universal position-snapshot reconciliation** (#3795): the reverse reconciler closes a DB-open strategy-attributed row on a non-order-status integration when its `(symbol,side)` is confirmed absent from a SUCCESSFUL `account_open_positions` snapshot (2-observation confirm, never on read-failure); Bybit stays on the forward order-status reconciler (the optional declared enhancement — there is NO per-broker default). **IB gateway-health gate**: `account_open_positions` now returns `None` (not `[]`) for a logged-out IB gateway (`net_liquidation` unpopulated), so a sustained logout can't false-close an open position.

(2) `IBClient._build_contract` gains a STK branch (`Stock(sym,'SMART','USD',primaryExchange=...)` + `qualifyContracts`) alongside the unchanged futures path; the per-symbol contract cache now matters more since one clientId can hold both a FUT and a STK contract. `tick_size_for` resolves the standard equity penny tick instead of falling through to the MES 0.25 default. (3) `Coordinator.multi_account_execute` resolves `market_type`/`whole_units` PER ORDER (symbol-aware, via `ib_instruments.ib_order_market_type()`) instead of trusting the account's static `market_type: futures` — an IB equity order now takes the whole-SHARE sizing path (round-up-to-1-share relaxation + margin/buying-power cap), MES/MGC/MHG keep the unchanged strict whole-contract path. NOT included: the `accounts.yaml` wiring that actually routes ETF strategies onto `ib_paper` (Tier-3, pending the mandatory `scripts/prop/account_compat_matrix.py` evidence run + explicit operator approval) and live paper verification — tracked in `docs/claude/performance-review-backlog.json::PB-20260707-IBKR-STK-ETF-SUPPORT`. | `config/instruments.yaml`, `src/units/accounts/ib_instruments.py` (NEW), `src/units/accounts/ib_client.py`, `src/core/coordinator.py`, `tests/test_ib_instruments.py` (NEW), `tests/test_ib_integration.py`, `tests/test_ib_sizing_and_data.py`, `docs/claude/performance-review-backlog.json`, this file | None on live-VM behaviour yet — purely additive contract-building + sizing-resolution capability; `ib_paper` doesn't route any ETF strategy until the separate Tier-3 accounts.yaml PR merges. MES/MGC/MHG unaffected (same `_build_contract`/whole-contract-sizing path, just resolved from the new per-symbol map instead of a hardcoded dict literal). |
| 2026-07-07 | (IBKR equity/ETF STK contract support, step 6 — `ib_paper` ETF wiring) | **`ib_paper` now trades 4 equity-ETF cells alongside MES/MGC/MHG, gated by the mandatory per-account compatibility matrix.** Completes step 6 of the design (operator-authorized "merge and continue" after the pre-established decisions). `scripts/ops/etf_account_compat.sh`'s `CELLS` array was missing `slv_pullback_1d` + `gdx_pullback_1d` (2 of the 16 alpaca_paper ETF cells) — added, params mirrored from `gld_pullback_1d`. Ran `ACCOUNTS=ib_paper bash scripts/ops/etf_account_compat.sh` on the trainer VM (issue #5908): 13/16 cells scored (3 skipped — no trainer-VM candle CSV for TQQQ/QLD/GDX), and **only 4 scored ROUTE against `ib_paper`'s own ruleset** (`risk_pct: 0.015`, far more aggressive than `alpaca_paper`'s 0.3% per-cell harness assumption): `spy_trend_long_1d`, `qqq_trend_long_1d`, `iwm_trend_long_1d`, `tlt_pullback_1d` (P(breach) 0.005–0.042, survival 1.0 on all four). The other 9 scored cells SKIPPED at that risk_pct — the same failure class as the TQQQ/QLD-on-`alpaca_live` gate in `PB-20260630-002` (a real edge still trips the breach cap at a risk_pct this high). Wired **only the 4 ROUTE cells** onto `ib_paper` (`config/accounts.yaml::ib_paper.strategies` += the 4 names, `.symbols` += `[SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT]`); the 9 SKIP cells and 3 no-data cells stay off `ib_paper` this pass — full rationale recorded inline in the `accounts.yaml` comment and in the backlog item. Live paper verification (design step 7 — place → journal → monitor → close a real fill) is the remaining follow-up. | `config/accounts.yaml`, `scripts/ops/etf_account_compat.sh`, `tests/test_ib_integration.py`, `docs/claude/performance-review-backlog.json`, this file | Live VM (next deploy): `ib_paper` starts evaluating SPY/QQQ/IWM/TLT signals and can place real IBKR paper-money equity orders for the 4 wired cells, in parallel with the same 4 already trading on `alpaca_paper` — cross-broker fill validation, no new strategy logic. MES/MGC/MHG unaffected. |

## Known gaps

Deliberate omissions and queued work. An entry here is a
**contract** between the team and future maintainers: the
architecture doc does not yet reflect this state, by design,
because the work is in flight or out of scope for the current
milestone.

| Gap | Why deferred | Tracking |
|---|---|---|
| **Orphaned mode-override dead code in `src/`** | **Behaviour remediated; residual dead code only (verified 2026-06-10).** The two Prime-Directive-violating vectors are gone: the breaker auto-flip is removed (rejection path at `src/core/coordinator.py:1669-1689` is alert-only) and the Telegram `/accounts dry\|live` handler was removed in #1933. What remains is **orphaned shim code with no caller** — `_DRY_RUN_OVERRIDES` + `set_account_dry_run()` (`src/units/accounts/__init__.py:33,36`), `Coordinator.set_account_dry_run()` (`coordinator.py:1760`), and the `account_state.yaml` dry-only override read (`coordinator.py:1100`). The promised safeguards-PR deletion never landed. | Cleanup PR (delete the dead dict + functions + override read). Low risk — no live caller. |
| **Per-trade RiskManager rejection → per-trade Telegram** | The Prime Directive (§ rules doc) requires every refusal to emit its own Telegram with account/symbol/side/qty/reason/exchange-error. Today's path uses aggregate alerts when conditions cluster. The per-trade wiring ships in the safeguards PR. | Safeguards PR. |
| ~~**WS5 baselines not yet at `shadow` in any registry**~~ | **Resolved.** The trainer VM is provisioned and the M14 program has been running training cycles for weeks; baseline + regime heads sit at `shadow` and log predictions live (`runtime_logs/shadow_predictions.jsonl`, surfaced on `/api/bot/shadow/*` + `/api/bot/trades/scores`). | Closed (M14 in progress). |
| **`shadow_model_ids` empty in production strategy YAML** | ~~Operator step~~. **Resolved 2026-05-19 by the default-flip + auto-wire.** Strategies that omit `shadow_model_ids` (or set it to `None`) auto-discover every model at `target_deployment_stage: shadow` and attach them as shadow predictors. The boundary between trainer-VM Claude and live trading moves from `shadow_model_ids` wiring to the `shadow → advisory` promotion gate; the latter still requires operator approval. | Closed. |
| ~~**Trainer VM not yet provisioned**~~ | **Resolved.** `ict-trainer-vm` (`158.178.209.121`) is up and running the ML lifecycle; read it via the `trainer-vm-diag` relay. The M14 ML-Optimization Program (S0–S18) has executed numerous training cycles on it. | Closed. |
| ~~**Trainer VM ↔ live VM data flow not yet wired**~~ | **Resolved.** The trainer pulls live `trade_journal.db` (read-only sync) and publishes its lifecycle artifacts back to the live VM via the trainer mirror (`runtime_logs/trainer_mirror/`), ingested into the federated `trainer_store.db` sidecar (`src/units/db/trainer_store.py`) and surfaced through `/api/bot/ml/*` + `/api/bot/backtests/sweeps`. | Closed (S-PERSIST-CANON). |
| **No open-source model layer (HF transformers as `Predictor`)** | WS6 not started. Per the master plan, defer until the WS8 feedback loop is observable end-to-end (drift detector + dashboard panels are live as of 2026-05-11; missing piece is real shadow predictions in production, which lands when the trainer + YAML wiring resolve). | WS6. |
| **`arch-doc-guard` is advisory, not blocking** | Hard-failing would push the team to bypass it. Upgrade path is a follow-up workstream once the workflow is fluent. The PR-template "Architecture impact: Not applicable" checkbox is the documented escape hatch when a change is contract-preserving. | Filed in S-AI-WS10 sprint log; revisit after ~20 successful PR cycles without bypass. |
| **`arch_doc_guard.py` does not validate a Change-log row was added** | The current heuristic checks "did any arch-doc path get touched"; it does not check "was a new row appended to ARCHITECTURE-CANONICAL.md's Change log". Easy to add but premature without the upgrade-to-blocking decision above. | Filed against WS10; would also need to enforce row-shape. |
| **No automated audit of the AI-TRADERS-ROADMAP.md Change log** | The doc-audit-weekly workflow audits the Verification Checklist for broken paths; it does not yet audit roadmap consistency (e.g., a workstream marked DONE in the roadmap but referenced as in-progress in a sprint plan). | Filed under WS10 follow-ups. |
| **Reduce-only fill correlation in S-030 monitor (Phase-2 follow-up)** | S-MSE-2 (PR #1138) wires reduce / close / flip legs through `execute_pkg(reduce_only=True)` and the dispatcher stamps `setup_type='intent_reduce'` on the journal row so reduce legs are distinguishable. The S-030 monitor loop in `src/runtime/order_monitor.py` still reconciles fills by `symbol + qty + side + timestamp` — a reduce leg lands as its own row in `trade_journal.db::trades` rather than updating the parent open trade's `position_size`. P&L attribution can briefly double-count the same exposure on the tick a reduce fires before the reconciler catches up. Distinguishable via `setup_type='intent_reduce'` and `notes.intent_reduce=True`. **The next `/performance-review` should explicitly grade whether any double-count appeared in the first live conflict between Turtle Soup and VWAP** (or in any session once ICT scalp activates). Fix is an `intent_reduce → parent` join in the reconciler. | S-MSE-3 — file the join + matching tests once a real conflict surfaces it (don't pre-emptively guess the parent-matching heuristic). |
