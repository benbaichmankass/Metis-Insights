# M28 — Signal-research ledger

The compounding record of every signal **construction** tried through the honest
gate, its verdict, and the learning. One row per construction (input × transform ×
conditioning × cross-section). Append-only; a null is a completed entry, never a
non-event (`RESEARCH-RIGOR-STANDARD.md` § honest negatives). Process + backlog:
[`M28-signal-research-methodology.md`](M28-signal-research-methodology.md).

Gate = `thesis_backtest_run.py` (P4) + `horizon_ic_scan.py --non-overlapping`
(honest t) + conviction spread (cost-aware). Bar = flagged-significant IC AND a
positive, cost-surviving conviction spread at a tradeable horizon.

| # | Input | Transform | Cond. | X-sec | Orient. | Honest verdict | Learning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Value (ERP/real-yield/GSR/OAS) | level percentile | none | time-series | value-native | `no_monetizable_horizon` — best IC 0.032@7d, t=1.06 | Level-percentile of a valuation series carries no honest short/mid-horizon edge on its own. |
| 2 | CFTC-COT large-spec net | level percentile | none | time-series | contrarian | `no_monetizable_horizon` — 90d "edge" was overlap inflation (t≈3.2 overlapping → **1.16 non-overlapping**), conv_spread negative | The apparent COT signal was a *measurement artifact* of overlapping windows, not a real edge. Level of spec positioning ≠ predictive. |
| 3 | Crypto funding/OI/basis | level percentile | none | time-series | contrarian (crowding fade) | nominal `monetizable_horizon_found` @1d (IC 0.070, t=2.10) but conv_spread **negligible** (+2 bps/day gross, net-negative after fees); 7–14d spreads not significant | There *is* a real 1d statistical signal in funding/basis crowding, but its magnitude is below fees. A bigger-magnitude construction or a longer horizon is needed to monetize it. |
| 4 | Gas storage↔price (M29 sysdyn) | mechanistic calibration (storage-anchored + weather HDD) | — | — | — | `park_deeper_investment` / `no_mechanistic_edge` — price readout ~0 OOS (storage OOS R²=−0.43, price OOS R²=0.002, not identifiable) | Graded on *calibration R²*, NOT yet through the signal gate. Distinct open question: does the model-implied **mispricing**, emitted as a snapshot signal, trade through the P4/horizon gate? (Next M29 step.) |

## Reading the ledger

The four entries share one construction cell — **level-percentile / no-conditioning
/ time-series** (entries 1–3) — and one calibration-not-signal test (entry 4). The
null pattern is evidence about *that cell*, not about the inputs. The
[methodology backlog](M28-signal-research-methodology.md#the-construction-backlog-what-to-try-next--the-dimensions-we-have-not-varied)
lists the unexplored dimensions (D1 transform, D2 conditioning, D3 cross-section,
D4 composite) each of these inputs can still be run through.

## Next entries (queued)

- **5 · COT change/divergence** — Δ net-spec (impulse) + large-spec-vs-commercial
  divergence, replacing the level percentile (D1). *Recommended first.*
- **6 · Crypto funding-change × OI-rising** — funding impulse conditioned on rising
  OI + basis premium (D1 + D2).
- **7 · Cross-sectional value/COT** — rank instruments against each other per date
  (D3), long-cheapest/short-richest basket.
- **8 · sysdyn mispricing as a snapshot signal** — emit the gas model's model-implied
  mispricing into the schema and grade it on the same instrument (M29 → the gate).
