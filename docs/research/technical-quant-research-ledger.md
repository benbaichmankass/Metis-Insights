# M30 — Technical quant-research ledger

The compounding record of every **technical / price-action feature→outcome
discovery** run through the M30 research platform, its honest verdict, and the
learning. The price-action counterpart of the macro
[`M28-signal-research-ledger.md`](M28-signal-research-ledger.md) — same
append-only discipline: **a null is a completed entry, never a non-event**
(`RESEARCH-RIGOR-STANDARD.md` § honest negatives). One row per study
(cohort × feature set × outcome × method).

Platform + method: the scoping doc
[`technical-quant-research-platform-scoping-2026-07-27.md`](technical-quant-research-platform-scoping-2026-07-27.md).
The instruments:

- **C1 panel** — `scripts/research/build_research_panel.py` joins each closed
  trade's **outcome** (`pnl`/`win`/R-multiple) to its **decision-time features**
  (structure vector + regime/vol categoricals + gates + model-score summary),
  leakage-stamped.
- **C2 toolkit** — `scripts/research/analyze_research_panel.py`: conditional
  edge/expectancy-by-bucket tables + multivariate logistic/ridge-OLS regression
  + permutation importance + correlation/VIF, **all under purged/embargoed
  walk-forward CV** (`ml.experiments.splitters.iter_folds`) + a Benjamini-Hochberg
  FDR control.

## The bar (why most rows will be nulls)

Discovery on the small real book — the M23 **~376-row wall** — manufactures
spurious correlations. The **M18 coin-flip prior** is binding: a feature is a
**LEAD, not a finding**, unless it **both**

1. **survives Benjamini-Hochberg FDR** at the chosen alpha over the full
   univariate-p set (never a single cherry-picked p), **and**
2. shows **positive out-of-sample discrimination** under the purged/embargoed
   walk-forward CV (OOS AUC > 0.5 for `win`, OOS R² > 0 for `r`) — an in-sample
   coefficient is never a gate.

A feature that clears both is still only a hypothesis to route into the C3
backtest→walk-forward bridge (the standing entry gate), never a direct
config change (that is Tier-3, operator-gated).

| # | Cohort · book | Feature(s) probed | Outcome | Method | Honest verdict | Learning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Synthetic** (platform validation — NOT a live finding) | injected `feat_confidence` (drives P(win)) + noise model-score features | `win` | C1→C2 end-to-end on a 220-row synthetic ISO-timestamped `trade_journal.db`; purged WF-CV (5 folds), BH-FDR α=0.1 | `platform_validated` — the injected signal is recovered end-to-end: **OOS AUC 0.72** across 5 purged folds, `feat_confidence` **tops permutation importance (0.25)** AND is the **sole BH-FDR survivor**; the noise features sit at ≈0 importance and do not survive. | **The platform works and the guards bite.** The CV recovers a real injected edge out-of-sample and the FDR correctly rejects the noise — so a null on the real book will be a real null, not a broken pipeline. This entry is a *pipeline* proof on fabricated data; it says **nothing** about any live strategy. The smoke that produced it also caught + fixed a real null-`closed_at` CV-crash bug (#7687) before the real-book run. |
| 1 | **`trend_donchian`, real-money** (live closed trades) | full decision-time panel (structure vector + regime/vol cats + gates + model scores) | `win` (+ `r` variant) | C1 `--strategy trend_donchian` → C2 (purged WF-CV, BH-FDR α=0.1) on the **live** `trade_journal.db` | **OPEN** — not yet run on the real book. Requires the live `trade_journal.db` (a VM-side run or a diag pull; not available from the sandbox). | *(pending)* First real feature→outcome discovery. Expected outcome distribution on ~376 rows is dominated by nulls (the coin-flip prior); the value is a **faithful, guarded** read, not a manufactured edge. |

## Reproducing a study

Run the two bricks in sequence against the book you want (real `trade_journal.db`
resolved by the canonical resolver, or `--db <path>`):

```bash
# C1 — build the panel for one strategy's real closed trades
python scripts/research/build_research_panel.py \
    --strategy trend_donchian --cohort real \
    --out runtime_logs/research/trend_donchian_panel.jsonl

# C2 — discover, under purged WF-CV + BH-FDR
python scripts/research/analyze_research_panel.py \
    --panel runtime_logs/research/trend_donchian_panel.jsonl \
    --outcome win --n-buckets 4 --fdr-alpha 0.1 --cv-folds 5 \
    --out runtime_logs/research/trend_donchian_analysis.json
```

The C2 report stamps the M18 coin-flip prior, the leakage contract (it refuses
to model if the panel's feature/outcome split is violated), the BH-FDR survivor
set, and the OOS CV metric per fold. Read the `.md` sibling for the human
summary.

## Next entries (queued)

- **1 · `trend_donchian` real-book discovery** — OPEN above; the first real
  study, run VM-side (or via a diag pull of the closed-trade panel) since the
  live `trade_journal.db` isn't reachable from a web sandbox. This is the
  natural first operator-facing run of the platform.
- **2+ · per-strategy sweep** — the same C1→C2 pass per live strategy with a
  non-trivial closed-trade count (`squeeze_breakout_4h`, `ict_scalp`,
  `htf_pullback_trend_2h`, …), each an appended row (edge or null). Pool by
  asset class where a single strategy's book is below the power floor.
- **C3 bridge** — any feature that clears BOTH bar conditions routes into the
  standing backtest→walk-forward gate (the entry-tuning gate), never a direct
  config change. That wiring is the next platform increment (C3), not a ledger
  study.

## Reading the ledger

Entry 0 is a platform-validation proof on synthetic data (the guards recover an
injected edge and reject noise); it is deliberately first so every real row
below can be read against a pipeline known to bite. Every subsequent row is a
real book run through the same honest gate. As with M28, the expectation is that
**most rows are nulls** — the small-book coin-flip prior guarantees it — and a
null recorded faithfully is the compounding asset: it tells the next session
which (cohort × feature) cells are exhausted so compute isn't burned re-deriving
a foregone result.
